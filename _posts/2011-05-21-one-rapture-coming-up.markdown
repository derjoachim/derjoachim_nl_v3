Oh goody! Today is another apocalypse! How many Worthy Ones will be Raptured away now?

At 6 pm local time (although noboby specified which time zone), the World is about to go up in flames again. I can only assume that New Zealand does not exist anymore. The True Believers (TM) will go to heaven. The rest will probably dine in hell.

I say let them be Raptured away. Far away. In Jupiter's orbit or something. We are better off without people who use their religion as a substitute for actual thinking for oneself.

Anyone who believes in a higher being without actually subscribing to a religion (or taking it too seriously), please stay. From my point of view, such a person does decide to think for herself. I can and do respect that. I may not agree with you, but at least we view each other as equals. In some sort of twisted way, these people are actually true believers.
