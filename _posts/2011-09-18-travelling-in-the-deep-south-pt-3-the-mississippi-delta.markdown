<p>Welcome to another installment of Joachim and Kim in the States. In this part we will venture deeper south and visit the states of Arkansas, Mississippi and Louisiana.</p>

<p>We left Memphis in the early afternoon. Our port of call was to be Clarksdale. The easiest way to get there, is by following Hwy 61. However, we decided to follow a parallel road, which led us through Arkansas, just across the Mississippi river. Any astute reader would tell me now that there is absolutely nothing there. She would be right. There isn't. But it is pretty. Furthermore, we wanted some long open road.</p>

<p>We followed the 78 through a vast rural area with (again) cotton fields, corn, wheat and some other stuff unidentifiable to agricultural laymen like us. Every 20 to 30 kilometers there would be a clump of trailers and shacks, along with a rusty gas station and that was 'town'. Since we wanted to pay Clarksdale a visit, we would be crossing Mississippi river near Helena - West Helena on the state border, thus directly driving into Clarksdale.</p>

<h2>Clarksdale, MS</h2>

<p>After a night in a rather sleazy motel there were two places that we would have to visit. The intersection of 49 and 61, and the Delta Blues Museum. First stop: the legendary crosroads.</p>

<p>According to legend, the blues musician <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Johnson" target="_blank">Robert Johnson</a> sold his soul to the devil on this intersection. In exchange for this, he was to be the best blues musician ever. At the age of 27, he was poisoned by a jealous husband and he died. It is not exactly certain where he was buried, but the legend was complete. The crossroads itself is little more than that. It has a few fastfood joints, a gas station and little more but a marker that claims that it is the crossroads.</p>

<p>The town itself had the same atmosphere as the motel: roach-infested, crumbling and desolate. Smack in the middle there is a former railway station, that has been converted into a museum. This is the Delta Blues Museum. It is a work in progress. The exhibits are all about the local blues heroes, like (of course) Robert Johnson, BB King, Sam Cooke, Ike Turner, and in particular Muddy Waters. Although it is a work in progress (they expand as they get the money to build it), it was definitely worth the few dollars and time.</p>

<h2>The road to Vicksburg</h2>

<p>Yet again, we left the standard route and went for the quaint option: highway 1. This is probably the first and last time you will hear this word for this road, for my English is lacking at this point. Again, we went for the long drive into absolutely nothing but rural country. Our most interesting encounter was a lake that stank of a rotting swamp. Apparenty, it had been overfished and there was a programme to reintroduce fish into that particular lake. They would have to be very tough fish.</p>

<p>We stopped in Greenville, MS for lunch at a diner that had been decorated in the 1970s and not changed a bit. It was ugly. However, the food was excellent. There was quite a separation between black people and white people. In the mall on the other side of the road, the patrons were all black (no exceptions), whereas our diner only had black people in the kitchen. We would notice this quite a few times in our upcoming travels.</p>

<p>Judging by the accent, we were in the middle of True Blood country. There were a few differences though, not counting all the supernatural stuff in the books and TV series. Whereas the patrons and waitresses in the series were without exception young, atlethic and multicolored, in real life it was exactly the other way around. The patrons were quite spherical, which, given the nature of the food was little wonder. THe average age amoung both personnel and patrons was over 45, and -again- we were the most outlandish people to set foot in that particular diner.</p>

<h2>Vicksburg</h2>

<p>Upon entering our distincty less crummy motel, we were interviewed by the lady at the counter. She gave us a warm welcome and a stern warning about the cities of Baton Rouge and New Orleans. Apparently, these are criminal hellholes, where 'they' prey on tourists. We promised her solemnly that we would take heed.</p>

<p>The historic center is more historic than the mansions tell you. Downtown Vicksburg looks as if some mansions have stood there for several hundred years. However, in 1862, one of the first major <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicksburg_Campaign" target="_blank">campaigns</a> of the Civil War was fought here, and a large portion of the town was destroyed. Nowadays, it is one of the more attractive stops for people who are travelling to or from New Orleans. It has a laid-back Southern vibe with its old style mansions, winding narrow streets, riverside boulevard and loads of antique shops. Antique should be taken in the broader sense. Everything that looks like it's from the 1950s or earlier, is labeled 'antique' regardless of actual age.</p>

</p>

<p>The following morning we visited the battlefield site. For its historical value, this site was given the status of National Park. Situated in a pretty, but dense forest over rolling hills, it had some tens of kilometers of asphalt to allow the American cars to visit any corner where ol' Great-Grampaw fought. Highlight of the park was a partially restored wreck of an Ironclad ship, the USS Cairo. This ship was sunk by one of the first mines (then called torpedo), and its wreck was dug up and restored in the last 45 or so years. It looked spectacular.</p>

<p>Other points of interest in this park were the state monuments. Many (if not all) states that participated in the battle erected huge monuments with lots of marble, bas-reliefs, huge statues and all the other features of your average momunent. These got a bit tiring. We skipped the momuments of the states that came in second in the battle. We jumped into our hideous but oh-so practical rental car and chose the 61 again.</p>

<h2>Natchez</h2>

<p>On the border of the Mississippi and Louisiana states there is another nice town. It is called Natchez and apparently, it was named after the natives who lived there before being kicked out of their territory. This town was very much like Vicksburg minus the bloody battle and the antique shops. What it did have, was a spectacular view on the Mississippi river. We walked there in the scorching heat, so we made our stroll as short as possible to avoid (a) sunstroke, (b) a carbon copy of the Vicksburg experience and (c) running out of time, thus missing a much needed late afternoon run.</p>

<h2>Driving into Louisiana</h2>

<p>After crossing the Natchez bridge, we drove into Louisiana, following the 84. Again, there were lots of cotton fields, but here it appeared to be harvest season. Bales of cotton the size of trailers were placed along the road. The cotton that was still unharvested, looked more fully grown, making the fields look like they had a bad case of dandruff.</p>

<p>Please wait for the next episode of our travels through the South. We will be visiting New Orleans, making a swamp tour and eat even more shrimp.</p>
