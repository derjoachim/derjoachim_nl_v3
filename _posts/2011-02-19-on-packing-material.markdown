<p>How much material do you need to ship a few pieces of copper wire? File this one under <em>curmudgeonery</em>.</p>

<p>Last week I bought a car radio. I bought it at a big international chain of car accesories. The salesman knew absolutely nothing of car audio, which is standard for large retail chains around the world. When I got home, I discovered that my particular brand of car needed a converter for a so-called ISO connector, which is essentially a bunch of copper wires connected to a fow pieces of molar. I wish that the aforementioned car audio salesman would have warned me, but hey, he already helped me as well as he could.</p>

<p>A few minutes of Googling gave me a few web shops that sold the correct converter cable. Good. One minute more and I found a Dutch web shop that sold them as well. Even better! Coincidentally, it was the same multinational that I bought the car radio at. The converter cable was pretty expensive. However, the next day it would be in. I made the order.</p>

<p>The next day I got a mail that there were some delivery problems. Although the web shop stated that the converter was in stock, apparently it wasn't. It was quite a polite mail, but not very informative. Thank you big multinational retailer!</p>

<p>Yesterday evening the mail man rang my doorbell. He had a nice square box, about 25 centimeres by 25 centimeters. I was pretty surprised. That's a big box for some copper wire and a piece of molar. It was taped so tightly, that I had to McGuyver it open. Inside it was a big piece of bubblewrap wound tightly around something. All in all it was about half a square meter of it. The wrapped-up thing appeared to be a blister with the coveted ISO converter cable thingy.</p>

<p>I must say that I am finally impressed by this big international retailer. The way it was packed! Wow! It would have withstood earthquakes, floods, crashes, toddlers, grizzly bear attacks, and possibly the awakening of Great Chthulhu itself! All that packing material to ship something for one unbreakable thing? Very thorough sirs! It's worth my Saturday morning, the nice picture shown below and a blog post!</p>
