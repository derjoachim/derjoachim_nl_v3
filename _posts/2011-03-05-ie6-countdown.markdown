Oooh! Here's a new one! Microsoft has launched a <a target="_blank" href="http://ie6countdown.com/">site</a> to keep people for using its own products! This calls&nbsp; for a rather old-fashioned rant! Old-fashioned in more ways than one I might add.

The War on Internet Explorer™ has reached a new chapter. Microsoft has launched <a href="http://www.ie6countdown.com/" target="_blank">http://www.ie6countdown.com/</a>. IE6 usage is apparently still at 2%. IMHO, that is 2% too much. The front page has the following text:

> 10 years ago a browser was born.Its name was Internet Explorer 6. Now that we’re in 2011, in an era of modern web standards, it’s time to say goodbye. This website is dedicated to watching Internet Explorer 6 usage drop to less than 1% worldwide, so more websites can choose to drop support for Internet Explorer 6, saving hours of work for web developers.

## Why do web developers hate IE6?

I have an Opinion on this. I want to share this Opinion with my readers. Let me start by saying that this utter piece of excrement has been plaguing the web developer for too many years.

### Web standards support

As someone who has been develeping web apps for quite some years now, this one stands out. The best reason to abolish IE6 is its utter disregard of any web standards. It has its own dialect of Javascript called JScript, which in many cases clashes with proper Javascript. It has terrible CSS support and many interesting new web techniques are simply not supported. How long did it take to support the canvas tag? Right.

To make matters worse, it took years and years before IE6 was updated. Even then, this was a half-assed botch job. For instance, the innerHTML tag, one of the few good ideas by Microsoft, started to misbehave. Suddenly, it stopped working with tables and other common elements.

Additionally, I have a few special words on VBScript, Microsoft's own web script language. If VBScript were a natural language, it would be Limburgish, which is roughly the Dutch equivalent of Nebraskan.

### Security holes

I do not have to explain myself here, do I? Let's just say that something that consistently needs so many security patches is not worth the trouble at all.

### Users

This one pisses me off most of all. This is Dumbness in Action. I know users who still use Internet Explorer, even though they know it's bad for them. These users are the equivalent of smokers or CDA voters (our own right-wing religious party): even if they know it's bad for them, they still keep defending their bad habits.

### IT managers and bad programmers

There are still people who want to support IE6, because of age-old web applications that otherwise would have to be rewritten. Why on earth did IT managers willinigly lock themselves in? There are way too many Mordacs in this world. If you do not know what I mean, open your favorite search engine and type in: Mordac, preventer of Technology.

I know that programmers are lazy by nature. But why support only IE? You people make me hate my job. You make us look bad. Please find a different job.

## Conclusion

As with many half decent ideas by Microsoft, they are too late. This web site should have been launched as soon as IE7 launched. This horrible product has been changing countless young, creative and entusiastic web developers into jaded, unhappy cranks. That includes me. I'd go even further and pull the plug on IE7+ as well.

The worst part is that even after ten years of repeating the points above, this rant is still current. I know that nothing original has been said here. I've been saying all these things for many years and so have countless web developers with any feeling for their jobs.

Dear Microsoft: please stop developing browsers. You aren't too good at it. The web has changed into something that even you are unable to keep up with anymore (if you ever were).
