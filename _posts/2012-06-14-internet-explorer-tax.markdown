<p>An Australian retailer has started charging users of Internet Explorer 7, since it costs too much to keep supporting said browser. The user can install a decent browser, thus avoiding the IE7 tax on the spot. Is this a good thing or not?</p>

<p>Users need to be made aware that using obsolete software is not a good idea for the same reason that you do not drink expired milk. It has gone bad.</p>
<p>The hours lost on debugging Internet Explorer-specific issues are traditionally many. While most other desktop browsers use more or less the same standards and methodology, Internet Explorer is known by web developers for its um.. quirks. Bluntly put, all versions up to 9 have their own 'standard'. These are often poorly documented (if at all), which results in costly work-arounds. The many hours lost by these hacks will have to be compensated for by the customer, who generally has little appreciation for this fact. Many web developers would prefer not to support Internet Explorer at all, but it is still a widely used browser.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A more hateful and frustrated version of me would have said let them bleed.&nbsp;There is a big <em>however</em> though. It is less than reasonable to penalize people for the software they use. This is a form of vendor lockout. I loathe the vendor, but as an Open Source enthusiast (and wanna-be &nbsp; contributor) I think that this is a bad message.</p>
<p>I do not mind chiding people for using piece of shit software, and I will happily pull the plug on old Internet Explorer versions, but charging people extra for using said software is a bridge too far. It reminds me too much of said vendors.</p>
