Once upon a time there was a desperate marketeer. It was given the assignment to get rid of third-rate produce and gaining ridiculous profits in the process.

Picture a board room of a large coffee factory. The senior executives, all born and bred in the babyboom generation, only wanted one thing and that was ridiculous short term profits with a minimum of effort. Their retirement would be in 10 to 15 years, and they had not paid off their second house yet. To make matters worse, the coffee crops had risen in price because of a bad season. As a result, they now had a large stock of poor quality coffee beans, which even they knew would be hard to sell.

Our marketeer was sweating under its designer clothes. It was in a bit of a pickle. Competition was high in the coffee market. Those pesky Italians were on to something with their luxury brands and shiny espresso machines. There had to be a solution to convert the espresso drinker to Dutch style coffee again, or Pim Fortuyn was a tolerant man with a good haircut and sound political ideas.

As our hero knew, a good way of getting rid of second rate stuff is seling it in very small units. In this case: portions of precisely one cup would do the trick. It should either be exclusive or easy to use. Failing the one demand for exclusiveness, which was of course quality, ease of use was to be the key.

A new dilemma appeared. How does one work with small portions, whereas the average coffee machine is built for flexible amounts? Our protagonist was wracking its little brain. It had to find an electronics manufacturer with the know-how of selling low-to-average quality stuff for high prices. Luckily, this large coffee factory was in the Netherlands, home of one of the experts in this field. Recently, it had opened a new TV manufacturer in Eastern Europe, which was to make poor quality televisions that were undistinguishable from average quality televisions. Yes, they were making things better. For themselves that was.

These two factories started their negotiations, and they came up with the biggest atrocity in coffee making since decaf. The coffee would be blended into something that tasted slightly of ashes, but not enough to scare off the average coffee drinker. This concoction would be divided in portions, roughly the size of a round teabag. Lukewarm water was to be dribbled through this teabag. The taste was not to be too strong, just to mask the quality of their product. One size fits all, right?

As a gesture of goodwill towards the sweetener and dairy industries, the taste would have to be bad enough to be diluted with sugar and milk, but just palatable enough to buy for its ease of use. Furthermore, the comsumer had to be told that this was an exclusive sensory experiece. It would have to get an italian-sounding name with a reference to taste. Yeah! That would work! It would even rack up the profits!

Thus, a new standard of overpriced blandness called the Senseo coffee system was born.
