<p>Welcome to part two of our travels through the South. This ramble will be about two cities in Tennessee that are linked with music: Nashville and Memphis.</p>

<h2>Nashville</h2>
<p>Nashville is said to be the capital of country music, along with Bakersfield, California. A few years ago we passed Bakersfield, and made sure not to be there too long. Not only do we not like country music, Bakersfield stinks of oil refineries. We ended up in Fresno, CA which as equally described as a hellhole.</p>
<p>When we planned our trip, we expected that Nashville would be a somewhat delapidated town with some country music clubs and little more. We were wrong. The first clue was the skyline that appeared on the horizon when we approached the city on the I-40. Our navigation device ensured that we would be steered into the dead center of town. After parking the Frankentaxi, we started exploring the city center. Fortunately, we quickly found the local Starbucks, allowing us to (a) get some caffeine into us, (b) get out of the scorching heat and (c) check our travel guide to see which bits were actually interesting. Since we went to the States to see over-the-top things, we decided that we should at least see the Country Music Hall of Fame.</p>

<p>Downtown Nashville actually looks pretty interesting. It has some modern big skyscrapers and stadiums, a lot of nice-looking clubs and restaurants and of course a lot of country-music related theaters, museums etc. In every way, it looks like a vibrant American city.</p>
<h3>The Country Music Hall of Fame</h3>
<p>Being refreshed by the <em>doppio</em> streaming through my blood, I led us to the Country Music Hall of Fame. Actuolly. it was quite an attractive building, which looked as if the architect wanted to give some visual clues on symbolic country music themes. One side of the building looked somewhat like the wings on a 1950s Caddilac, whereas the other side looked like a radio tower. When we got in, we were directed to the top floor, which was about the genesis of country music. It dived into the many folk subgenres that would later be lumped into what is now known as country music. This was an attractive mix of memorabilia, small biographies of former stars (some dating to the 1920s),sound clips, movie clips and vintage posters. Its message was that country music was the normal man's music.<br /> The exhibition on the second floor highlighted the things that make me loathe country music in the first place. Here were the big stars. A large portion of this floor was dedicated to the three Hank Williamses and all their singing clan members. This looked more like a shrine than anything else, but the image I actually got, was of a bunch of spoilt Hillbilly megalomaniacs with an inflated self-image, too much money and a very bad taste. This is exactly what makes me loathe country music in the first place. On this floor, many more modern country stars got their own place. These were pretty diverse in genre (from country rock to folk to MTV starlets). Furthermore, there was the actual hall of fame that had all 'members' depicted in hideous copper plaques.</p>
<p>Our verdict on Nashville is that is really nice to kill a few hours there, unless you are into country music. Then you will truly have walked into your own personal Walhalla.</p>
<h2>Dodging the interstate, following Hwy. 70</h2>
<p>Lunch time was upon us, most shops on Broadway were either closed, or so tacky that we walked by them in a great hurry. Instead of going back onto I-40 we decided that we would follow the parallel highway 70 to catch more of the Tennessee vibe. For lunch, we ended up in a fast food joint just outside the city of Dickson, munching away lots of shrimp.</p>
<p>Moving more inland, we encountered cotton fields, lots of crumbling old towns with equally crumbling old people, and actually little else. Cotton plants are low, brown and get lots of white stuff on them as they grow ripe for the plucking. Crumbling little towns can be found anywhere in the States. From a distance, they have a certain charm. It's these little rides that make travelling through the States worth the delay. However, little of note was encountered, so we fast forward to the next destination.</p>
<h2>Memphis</h2>
<p>Memphis is known for many interesting things. As with Nashville, we came for the musical history. There's plenty of that in Memphis.First and foremost, it is the Blues capital of the USA. Furthermore, it is where Elvis Presley lived.</p>
<h3>Graceland</h3>
<p><img class="caption" style="margin-right: 10px; float: left;" title="Graceland" src="images/stories/usa2k11/usa_11_2_2.JPG" alt="Graceland" width="600" /><br style="clear: none;" />Our first stop would be Graceland. Again, we wanted to see over-the-top sights and thought that Graceland would match that description. We weren't disappointed, but mildly surprised. The entry price is a bit steep, with its $10 parking fee and $30+ entry fee. That being said, it is worth a few hours of your time. The house itself is relatively modest. It is big, but not huge. Of course it is quite luxurious, and for its time quite modern. However, it did not have the gaudiness of what you see at MTV cribs.<br /> Aside from the house, there is a number of secondary buildings that house a recording studio, a sports court and a little administration office-annex-firing range. In these buildings, lots of memorabilia were shown to the public. The exhibition was quite respectful, without the slavish devotion. It was actually less tacky than I thought it would be. Mr. Presley apparaently had a much better taste than his fans.</p>
<h3>Downtown Memphis</h3>
<p>My first exploration was a mid-afternoon run through the riverside district. It enabled me to see some interesting places,that I would certainly have missed. These included an upper class neighbourhood that would be shut down hermetically after dark, some old crumbling cotton warehouses with interesting graffiti and a pleasant riverside park. If you have time to kill, a stroll on the riverside is well worth the effort.</p>
<p><img class="caption" style="margin-right: 10px; float: left;" title="Beale Street" src="images/stories/usa2k11/usa_11_2_3.JPG" alt="Beale Street" width="600" /><br style="clear: none;" />After my run, it was time to get to know downtown a bit better. Beale Street is where the action is. It has the old clubs and restaurants, and of course its fair share of tourist trap souvenir shops. The souvenirs looked interesting enough if you are into music-related artifacts or shirts that claim that you have been somewhere, which got you a lousy garment.  A few blocks from Beale Street, we encountered the Gibson factory and the Rock&Soul museum. Unfortunately, the museum was almost closed by the time we got there, so we will have to visit it later. The Gibson factory looks quite interesting. Again, it was quite late, so we did not take the tour.</p>
<p>One of the things about Beale Street is that it is somewhat like a carnival. Many clubs and restaurants have their own musicians, which result in a cacophony. Add to that a certain seediness, and the image is complete. That being said, it is probably the only street I have seen that is barred to all traffic except motorcycles. I like it there.</p>
<h3>Rock & Soul Museum revisited</h3>
<p>The next morning, we did get the time to visit the Rock & soul Museum. This attractive little museum highlights the music history, centerd on Memphis. It showed the evolution of music in the city, that developed along with its turbulent past. A nice added feature was that each room had its own 'jukebox' (in most cases being embodied by an actual jukebox), where you could pause and listen to as many songs as you liked on your headphone. The only slight disappointment is that the timeline abruptly stopped around 1970. That would imply that the last 40-ish years nothing relevant to music came out of Memphis. I find that hard to believe.</p>
<p>In the next part, we will go further south and end up in the Southern states.</p>
