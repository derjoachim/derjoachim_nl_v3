<p>Sometimes it is best to stop innovating. I rediscovered the Amarok 1.4 User Interface. It has a new name: Clementine Music Player. Back in 2008, I had the perfect music player. Then Amarok 2.0 come out. In many ways, it was a step back.</p>

<h2>Amarok 1: Killer app</h2>
<p>Back in 2005, I discovered a neat KDE app that was a music player and collection manager at once. It was called after a Mike Oldfield album. In short, it blew me away. It was one of the real killer apps. Back then, winamp was the way to go for many people. iTunes was already there and had a decent way of managing my music collection. However, it never ran (or runs) on Linux.</p>
<p>Its concept was copied into a number of other music players, like Songbird and Exaile. GUI-wise, it became something of a standard. When the first stories about Amarok2 began to appear, I was more than anxious to try it.</p>
<h2>2.0: Disappointment</h2>
<p>In the beginning of 2009, I finally installed the 2.0 version, and in many ways, it was a step back. Some perfectly good functionality like playing audio CDs had been thrown away. Furthermore, it was slow compared to 1.4. Last but not least, the GUI had been redesigned, and it was ugly.</p>
<p>The user base was angry. However, the Amarok development team was apparently of the KDE4 design philosophy: the .0 Version was not for the weak of heart and more of a development release. And to be honest, at least Amarok 2.1 and 2.2 were more usable. In 2.2 I could almost play an audio CD. More or less.</p>
<h2>Goggles Music Manager: good, but... </h2>
<p>Since my main computer was my netbook and my PC was nothing more  than a backup medium, I had to find an alternative. Amarok 2 is a bit too heavy. For some time, I stuck to <a target="_blank" href="http://code.google.com/p/gogglesmm/">Goggles Music Manager</a>, but IMHO, it falls short when adminstering large music collections. However, it was lightweight, had a very decent UI and it was (and is) actively maintained.</p>
<h2>iTunes: meh.</h2>
<p>In the meantime, I got a shiny new laptop for my job: a Macbook Pro. The media player that was shipped with it, at least got a decent chance to make itself loved. It didn't. I missed a number of features: play from folder, FLAC support, some playlists were imported either in duplicate or not at all. The search interface is good, the music browser less so. All  in all: meh. I only use it  for podcasts now.</p>
<h2>Clementine: yay!</h2>
<p>Recently, I was trying to find a decent alternative to iTunes and quickly found <a target="_blank" href="http://www.clementine-player.org/">Clementine</a>, which is at version 0.7 at the moment. Do not be alarmed by the low version number: it is quite mature already. Clementine is a direct QT4 fork of the Amarok 1.4 branch after all. When I first opend it, it felt like coming home after a long hard journey. The GUI looks like a 2011 UI, and all the good bits of amarok 1.4 were there.</p>
<p>On my old netbook, which is old and slow and has hideous disk space issues, it runs snappily, even over NFS. All in all, including all codecs, it takes up some 50 MB of disk space. Everything I missed in other media players is there. The only thing I have not got working well, is podcast support.</p>
<p>The program that was a killer app back in 2005, still remains one in 2011. Of course it has evolved, and even has a new name. However, it remains the best music player. Period.</p>
