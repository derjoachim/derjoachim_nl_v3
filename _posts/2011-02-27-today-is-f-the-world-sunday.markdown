<p>Although I planned my Sunday to be as productive yet relaxing as possible, I decided that I would be &nbsp;a cranky, miserable bastard today.</p>

<p>It is one of those cold rainy weekends. You know that you could do a lot of little chores that would make your life easier, the house more complete or beautiful or the people around you a lot happier. Yet, you do nothing useful whatsoever. The weather is piss poor, it has been like that the entire weekend, and although there is so much to do, you decide that today is officially lost. You crawl back on the couch, shuffle your GTD inbox and peer miserably out of the window, seeing nothing but dull greyness.</p>
<p>On my afternoon run, I came up with a name for days like today: <strong>Fuck the World Sunday</strong>. &nbsp;Then, I decided I had enough and walked home.</p>
