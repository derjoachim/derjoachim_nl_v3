Dear reader. I'm back. Somewhere back in 2012, I became bored, wanted to refactor, did some tinkering, lost track of time, became a father and BAM! It's August 2014.

The new site was built on a lot of interesting stuff, including Bootstrap 3 and nicely compiled LESS files. I kept the old color scheme. It looked nice enough.

At the moment, the site is a bit sparse. I was forced to kick out some old modules and some old content. However, maybe somewhere along the line, it will return.

Furthermore, there are some issues. I am ironing them out. The design needs some decluttering, some whitespace should either be added or moved out and small screens probably have some issues as well.

Bear with me. I promise it will be fun.

In the meantime, check out [medium](http://medium.com) for some quality content.
