Last tuesday, a lawsuit of [Brein](http://www.anti-piracy.nl/), the Dutch IP protection association against [two](http://www.ziggo.nl/) [ISPs](http://www.xs4all.com)) was won. Both ISPs are forced to block access to [The Pirate Bay](http://www.thepiratebay.org). This is bad on many levels. Here's but a few of them.

## Censorship

One of the obvious conclusions that can be drawn is that censorship is being facilitated. Basically, a representative of a powerful and rich lobby does not want the average person to have information on a subject that does not suit that lobby. They abuse our jurisdictional system to keep users from getting that information. In my book, that is censorship. Basically, this verdict means that with sufficient money, you can have ISPs block any web sites you do not like. That is some scary shit.

## Obsolete Business models

There is a number of reasons why people (semi-legally or illegally) download stuff. Most of these reasons have to do with flaws in current business models of the entertainment industry. 

### Cost

The price is not right. 50 Euros for a new video game is way too much for the average gamer, I do not want to spend 20+ euros on a CD with just a few decent songs, and I do not want to pay 40 to 50 euros for the first season of a series that is already in its forth season in all other countries. If my sources are correct, it is not the artists themselves that benefit from these absurd prices, but rather the big labels.

### Lack of alternatives

I do not mind paying for content, but I prefer to do it on my terms. I want recent content in a convenient format for a decent price. If I want to view that hot new TV series (or movie) I read about, I have to wait at least two years to appear on local television. Additionally, our networks take out all the fun by irregular scheduling, stopping mid-season and long commecial breaks. I could wait for an overpriced DVD box, that will collect dust on shelves for eternity after watching it once or twice, but that hardly seems like a good idea.

What I want, is to pay a realistic amount of money, so I can download that series and view it at my convenience. I want to store it on my NAS, and not on a shelf. And I want to view this series as soon as it gets out in the open. 

It. Does. Not. Exist. Here. That is retarded.

## Incompetent Judge

It is clear that the wrong judge was put on this case. It is evident that he (or she) has no knowledge on Internet-related issues. Furthermore, he (or she) has a [flaky grasp on statistics](http://tweakers.net/reviews/2446/2/brein-vs-punt-pirate-bay-internet-naar-de-haaien-de-motivatie-van-de-rechter.html) at best, and the information provided appears to have been manipulated by Brein. The judge appears not to be able to see through that.

Furthermore, the judge appears to treat this case as one with purely financial interests. TPB is being blocked because it is being used to download stuff that could otherwise be bought.

It is this kind of old-fashioned nincompoops that actually has the power to make ill-informed decisions on such an important matter as this one. The judge is incompetent and should not be doing any Internet-related cases.

One (not so fun) fact: Our IP law is from (drumroll) 1912. One of the reasons that the providers are being sued, is because of  a 100 year old law. As much as the world has moved on since then, this law has not. It is utterly calcified.

## ISPs are not the law

One of the reasons that both ISPs were opposing Brein, is that they will be required to act as some kind of policeman. They do not want to do that. They do not have the resources. Furthermore, there is this notion that information should be accessible. 

## It is a useless verdict

If the domain The Pirate Bay is blocked, a user can do many things to get the stuff he wants. As such, the verdict is of little consequence. He can visit any other download sites, he can use a [proxy](http://proxy.org/cgi_proxies.shtml) to visit the Pirate Bay, he can use the [Tor network](https://torproject.org), or he can switch ISPs.  I heartily advise against the last option. Regardless of their own motivations, they are doing a good thing: protect the Internet user from IP parasites. Let's not punish them by walking away from them.
