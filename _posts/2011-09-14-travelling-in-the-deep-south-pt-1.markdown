<p>Here's part one of our adventures while travelling through the Southern US states. Y'all sit back and enjoy.</p>

<p>Our journey started September 10. We got through the TSA in record time. They were even friendly and cooperative, and before we knew it, we were waiting in an utterly relaxed way for our connecting flight.</p>

<p>While waiting for the connecting flight, we talked to an very friendly middle-aged black lady. I'd say African-American, but since she called herself black, why the political correctness. She had the same feeling about Europe as we about the US. It is full of crazy people. We have already been to the States twice, and she had been to Europe, so our mutual opinions were not entirely based on superstition and prejudice.</p>

<p>The nice lady had one thing in common with many people we would meet later: lots of friendly smiles and lots of talking. Not in the one-way sense either.</p>

<h2>Atlanta pt. 1</h2>

<p>We landed in Atlanta, which is one of the poorer cities in the States. It looks as if there is this welfare program. There are lots of personnel around, who stand all day waving people into the right direction. This may look like a dead end job. However, contrary to other people in such jobs, they were smiling, helpful and not being surly. Seeing that Altanta has such a high poverty rate, I cannot help but thinking that they have to keep up appearances.There are countless others who can do their jobs. Maybe I am just being cynical, and they are actually happy with their jobs.</p>

<p>Part two will have to wait. We will be visiting the city on the end of our journey.</p>

<h2>Our rental car</h2>

<p>Next stop: car rental agency. Again, everybody was being friendly and helpful, and standing around doing little besides point people into the right direction. We picked ourselves the most hideous car we could find, and got to the hotel. It really looks like the illegitimate love child of an English taxi and a Morris Minor. However, it is spacious for its size, it has everything you need for a long drive and it handles well for its size. No complaints there. However, there was a problem (which we only discovered while reaching the hotel): the car appeared to be missing a keyfob, the little remote control device that opens your car. So the next morning we returned to the car agency, and after being directed into the right direction by the nice people again, we found ourselves an equally hideous car. Good. Now we could look silly again.</p>

<h2>Day one: Atlanta GA- Blue Ridge NC</h2>

<p>Every good day starts with a hearty breakfast. This was complementary. The woman in the breakfast room was broadly smiling when we got in. Apparently, she had already had a long night. Beside overseeing the guests having their breakfasts, she drove the airport shuttle bus. But, as any other Atlantan we met, she was overly happy and spreading it to anyone who needed some more.</p>

<p>During a long visit to a Starbucks along the road, I made an interesting discovery: salted mocha. This is the new food of the Gods. That is, if there were any gods in the first place. A salted mocha tastes somewhat like liquid M&amp;Ms, but with salt.</p>

<p>Our first destination of the day was Dahlonega, GA. This so-called historic town was quaint as only a faux-historic town can be: the center looks like a postcard with lots of overweight tourists, bikers, veterans and us. Not too interesting, but good for a nice stroll. After a few more hours in our Frankentaxi we reached our destination for the day: Blue Ridge,NC. This was maybe a bit more 'historical', since it had its own scenic railway,its fair share of old cars and more quaint little tourist trap shops. That being said, it looked quite attractive. The locals were friendly, the smells from the restaurants inviting, and it had a number of quaintly overgrouwn-with-kudzu houses that looked quite attractive if you are into Anne Rice novels.</p>

<h2>Day two: Blue Ridge NC - Cooksville TN</h2>

<p>I can be short about the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Smoky Mountains: they are pretty areas, but not too special. However, if you happen to own a motorcycle, there are few better places to wear down the sides of your tires than the endlessly curving roads.</p>

<p>North Carolina appears to have one historical point of interest. Every licence plate refers to this one little event of a pair of well-meaning bike repairmen who made the first flight. Since we were really far from this spot, I felt that their pride was a bit misplaced.</p>

<p>We ended up in Cooksville, TN. Again, this appears to be a historic town. Judging by the huge number of chain motels, fast food joints and gas stations, it is more like a resting place for weary travellers. That was convenient, because we were getting tired indeed. I did a late afternoon run, that was extremely warm. I noticed one thing besides the fact that the climate is harsh to long-distance runners: for some reason, the adult store (called the Love Shack) is next to the Harley Davidson dealer. I think that that may have something to do with the fact that both groups like to wear leather or something.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for further stories. I will be recounting stories about Nashville and Memphis. It is not what I thought it would be.</p>
