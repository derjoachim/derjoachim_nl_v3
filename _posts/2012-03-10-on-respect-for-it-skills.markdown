Earlier this week, our minister of internal affairs launched one of her 'brain'-farts. Students were to be invited to try to hack government servers and applications. Free of charge. Sadly, this attitude towards IT skills as something that I encounter daily.

## Lack of vision

One of the articles that triggered this rant can be read [here](http://www.nu.nl/column-zaterdag/2760146/beveiligings-carnaval.html). The gist is that it may seem a good idea, but only shows our government's utter incompetence and underestimation of computer security (and IT in general). The best one liner of this column is roughly translated: 'Our government knows as much about IT as president Assad of First Aid'. It is quite harsh, but sadly, it is true.

Our government (at least: the political parties who are actually in the Cabinet) has an utter and total lack of vision on IT. They totally misunderstand Intellectual Property in the 21st century, their lack of IT infrastructure -and knowledge- is biting them in the ass, and instead of doing anything about that situation, they are killing our educational system.

## No freebees

Apart from the rant above, there is a totally different reason why I hate this proposal: this idea is insulting. I have been in this business for over a decade. I am more or less self-educated, and I am making a decent living out of it. Once in a while, somebody asks me for 'advice' on an IT-related issue. However, what they actually want, is for me to fix their IT-related problems, *without them doing any effort themselves*. Their lame excuse is that they do not understand this computer stuff.

Imagine going to a surgeon for a free operation, a cook for free food or a car mechanic for a free, yet complicated repair. These situations are inconceivable. However, if IT skills are involved, people are trying to freeload. Well, fuck you! I am not doing that. If you do not know how to use something, you either teach yourself, or pay somebody to do it for you.

## The IT Stigma

This story irks me for another reason: there is this stigma about being in IT. You automatically get a label that claims that you lack social skills. Granted, there are many colorful, 'out-of-the-ordinary' people in IT. However, this does not mean that one in by definition a sociopath because of the career he (or she) chose. We are not monkeys who do free tricks. We work with knowledge and information, and thus play an important, yet underrated part in our society.

## (the lack of) Thinking for Oneself

People's inability or unwillingness to think for themselves may account for the fact that religious (and populist) political parties still have such a strong voice in our government. Sadly, this mental apathy will continue to haunt us for many years to come.
