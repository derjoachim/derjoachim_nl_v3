<p>I am a bit jealous of my one year old son. Every day he keeps discovering things that have long been trivial for the adult world. He does this with a triumphant smile and welcomes his newfound knowledge with an abundance of joy. 17 months later, the text 'Hello World' that we sent to our friends and families appears to be spot on.</p>

<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>A traditional way of starting the journey into a new programming language, is by writing a script or program that simply outputs 'Hello World'. It was this excitement that I tried to convey to my friends and family when my son was born. I was at the start of an entirely new era, that of being a father. Therefore, instead of a cheesy rhyme, we simply put the 'Hello World' text on a card. My developer friends and colleagues loved it.</p>
<h1>Keep Learning</h1>
<p>One important life lesson I learnt in the past ten years is that personal development is achieved or kept up by learning some new things every year or so. One could learn a new language (natural or programming), a new musical instrument, or a new sport. One could travel to unknown places or learn to drive a new vehicle. One must always keep reading interesting stuff. One could switch careers. The important thing is: just keep moving. Keep your body and mind occupied, lest you get rusty.</p>
<h1>Seizing the Day</h1>
<p>The old adage of 'Carpe Diem' means that you should make the best of the present, because you cannot know the future. I found this to be true, but somewhat lacking. 'Carpe Diem' is easy to abuse. One can fully live in the present without preparing oneself for the future, which I do not think that the original writer intended.&nbsp;</p>
<h1>SALVE MVNDE</h1>
<p>Observing my son has reminded&nbsp;me of an important thing: keep discovering. There is a world out there that is too interesting to ignore. I am going to abuse the Latin language here and propose a new adage: Salve Munde, which very roughly translates as 'Hello World'. Start new things, lest the future obsoletes the stuff&nbsp;you already know. Find your pleasure in the discovery of new knowledge and share it with your loved ones.</p>
<p>(<em>Edit by Joachim, 18-11-2014: Salve Mund<strong>i</strong> should actually be Salve Mund<strong>e</strong>, since one would use the vocative case</em>)</p>
