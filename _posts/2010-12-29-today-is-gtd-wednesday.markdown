<p>Since I have the evening for myself, and I'm home from work early, I'd use my 'free' evening to get some stuff done.</p>

<p>I finally know what to get for my old car (too little), what to pay for a proper replacement (too much) and that makes things more complicated.</p>
<p>Next job: clean up some mess after the Christmas weekend. Done.</p>
<p>Next: send that email to my ex-colleague, who I helped pick a new motorcycle. Umm... Wrong laptop. Will do it tonight. :)</p>
<p>Close down my old web site and have it point to the new one (you're reading it now). Hmmm. What was the proper procedure again? Oh well, let's just finish this post then.</p>
<p>Ah. The really bad thing: brush up my skills with the gimp and make some proper graphics for my brand new web site.</p>
<p>I have a bad feeling that this evening will prove to be less productive than I initially hoped.</p>
<p>[Edit]: at least I got the logo done. Sending the mail now. :)</p>
