Today is a remarkable day. For the first time since 1983, I live in a house that has no desktop computers. All I have is two laptops and a NAS.

## Remade

It's weekend again, and I have some downtime for myself. Time for some well-earned rambling. Since the late 1990's, all my personal computers were somehow named after characters in books. Sickbock, Dickerdack, Enoch, Remade and Anansi spring to mind. It is a neat system, and gives you geek cred.

Anyone familiar with China Mieville's steampunk series, knows about the Remade. Basically, the Remade are the steampunk variety of cyborgs. That is a cool concept. I built Remade in 2005. My old PC had died prematurely. It was a 3 year old PC and it had several servicable parts. Since I had just read Perdido Street Station, the hostname was quickly chosen.

### Remade remade

An upgrade was made in early 2007. The PSU died. That was a good moment for a partial upgrade. I was remaking Remade. Cool! Among other things, I bought myself a passively cooled video card. Since the motherboard was still recent, I was stuck with AGP. Since one of my gripes with remade's then current configuration was its noise, I made sure to buy silent components. When remade still appeared quite noisy, I added some foam and other noise-dampening materials to it.

At that time, my primary computer was Remade. Video games were performing quite well (the games I played at least), and all the other stuff was done using my Kubuntu desktop. With my shiny 20" widescreen monitor, I could not be happier. Since the gaming had become more prevalent, I had moved my PC to the living room.

## Along came a spider

In 2008, there was an exciting new thing in the world of computers. Asus released a laptop the size of a pocket book. The netbook was born. It must be mine! The first model had a pitiful 7" screen, which even then was hardly useful at all. However, a 9" was announced with a more decent 1024 by 600 resolution. The very day it was launched here in the Netherlands, I bought one. When I first booted the netbook, I was stunned. Within mere seconds, I had a workable desktop! Wow!

I replaced the piss-poor Xandros impementation by an early netbook version of Ubuntu. The hostname was quickly chosen: anansi. I had just read Neal Gaiman's Anansi Boys.

## The beginning of the end

Even with the main PC in the living room, it was rarely used anymore. Sure, when some photo editing had to be done, I needed a mouse and decent screen. The odd game still had to be played. And of course: my documents had to be archived every once in a while. Remade grew more and more into a backup medium. It still performed well for the things it was supposed to do though.

In September 2009, me and the wife moved to a bigger house. I made myself a nice room for working, studying and keeping loads of books. Although my father was joking, his name for the room was pretty appropriate: the gentlemen's room (Herenkamer in Dutch, not the men's toilet:) ). It was pretty well secluded from the rest of the house, and I could do my work (or fun stuff) in relative peace, even when the wife had her friends over.

In the 18 months that Remade was booted, it was to make backups of all my current documents, to play music when I was working in the garden, or do some unwanted stuff in Windows, like filling out the yearly income tax. A few months ago, I made the decision that Remade was to be replaced. Whatever it would be, it would not be a desktop PC anymore.

## Remade unmade

A new process was started. What would I need to replace Remade? A decent new laptop perhaps? This would make Anansi obsolete as well, thus killing two birds with one stone. I wanted to wait though. At 2,5 years, I was not quite ready to say goodbye to Anansi.

At work, I got a new laptop. Twice. The first one was a nice HP 13" version. Although I replaced it in six weeks flat, I really like that machine. However, I was given an even better machine: a Macbook Pro. For me this alleviates the need for a fast notebook. If there is anything I need to do which requires a lot of processing power, I use my Macbook Pro.

A few days ago, I ordered a NAS. My archival / backup medium has finally been replaced. Furthermore, this NAS apparently has excellent multimedia capabilities.

This morning, with a heavy heart, I disconnected my trusty old PC. I took out all the parts that can be reused. Hopefully, these will live on, thereby remaking Remade.
