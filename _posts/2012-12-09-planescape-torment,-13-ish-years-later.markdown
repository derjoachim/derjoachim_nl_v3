The unthinkable happened: a sequel to my favorite game of all time [is in the works](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-12-03-chris-avellone-blesses-inxiles-planescape-torment-successor). My inner geek is squealing with delight. Here. Have some nostalgia.

Planescape: Torment is a Computer Role Playing Game based on the famed Infinity Engine, which also powered the famous Baldur's Gate series. It was set in the Planescape universe in the Dungeons \& Dragons tabletop RPG. When P:T came out late 1999, it received rave reviews, even if it was only single player and the graphics were obsolete. In 1999, it was just not done to release a 2D game. However, the story was intricate to say the least, it had a number of different endings, and it could be played in several ways.

First of all, the game was extremely atmospheric. The fantasy setting was sheer genius, ranging from baroque to victorian with a healthy dose of surrealism. The sound and music were haunting and the graphics both gritty and intricate. In all honesty, the battle system was sometimes somewhat kludgy, but the focus on the game was not hack \& slash, but character development.

The best part of the game though was its story and its character development. The main character is called The Nameless One. He wakes up in a morgue and discovers that he remembers absolutely nothing. The game is ultimately about finding out about the history of The Nameless One. During the game, you find several characters. Some of them will join you in your search for the past. Every party member is an enigma, with a back story, that interconnects with the history of the Nameless One. Every now and then, you have to interview them. Dependent on the answers you choose, you find out pieces of the Nameless One's past, not only gaining experience, but also well, information.

It is primarily the sheer complexity of the story that made me play the game twice in a row. In its entirety. You could play the game twice and find out about totally different parts of the Nameless One's past. Some party members were extremely difficult to find, yet interesting enough to warrant such a long search.

This concept was ambitious, perhaps too ambitious. The script is said to have 800.000 words in it, which is a staggering amount. The game did not sell well. Ultimately, the developer went out of business. Speculations on the reasons of its poor sales range from not being multiplayer to being too complex and too little hack and slash. Whatever the actual reasons, for me Planescape:Torment may be the best computer game I have played, and one of the few that actually deserves a sequel.
