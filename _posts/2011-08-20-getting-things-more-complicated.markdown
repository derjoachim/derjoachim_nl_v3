<p>My GTD 'career' has lasted little over a year. Although I am not religiously holding on to it, it helps me to be more organized. One observation of mine is that although I get more stuff done, things have become more complicated. Since the idea of the GTD method is to simplify things, this may seem a paradox.</p>

<h2>Perfectionism</h2>
<p>I once met somebody who said that her partner had a depression because he was a perfectionist. That sounded quite strange to me; for me, perfectionism is a good trait. After diving into GTD, I finally got an understanding on what she meant. It is frustrating to be unfinished forever. The more you think things through, the more things you discover that nag you.</p>
<h2>DIY Spree</h2>
<p>For the last month or so, I have spent many hours of manual labour into my home. My list of things to be done was pretty big at the start of this DIY spree. I've worked hard and I've seen many good results. I got rid of a lot of clutter, and my home looks better as well. I finally took the effort and time to do something about a lot of things that were bugging me. </p>
<p>After another sunday of hard work, I counted the items on my TODO list. It had grown considerably. Hmmmm... </p>
<h2>One finished job spawns two others</h2>
<p>Since I bought my house and turned it into a home, I discovered a simple truth that many homeowners already know: you are never done. Every time you finish a certain task, you find several more that require your attention. One of the things I do, is write these things down to fix later. </p>
<p>An empty (or more-or-less managable) GTD list is a good goal, but hardly attainable. Furthermore, it is a means to an end. It is a way to get all those nagging little things out of your head. As long as you have the discipline to not only collect these tasks, but also undertake actions to get them sorted out, you are good. However, never expect to be done. You will always find new things to fix.</p>
<p>Herein lies the reason that the GTD method makes things more complicated for me. In order to get stuff organized, I have become more of a perfectionist. My TODO list has grown instead of shrunk. I got more structure and discipline, thereby raising the bar for myself. One could say I have leveled up. </p>
