<p>Currently, there is a raging discussion in the Linux community on the death of the Linux Desktop and who is to blame for it. For years, people have been claiming that the Linux desktop was going to get its breaktrough, but that promise never quite went true.</p>

<p>In short, Miguel de Icaza, the former lead developer of the Gnome desktop environment, <a href="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2012/Aug-29.html" target="_blank">blames</a> the community's 'developer culture' for the death of the Linux desktop. By innovating for the sake of innovating, and cultivating a hackish culture, Linux missed the big picture, and simply lost the chance of ever making it as a desktop OS. This spawned an interesting <a href="https://plus.google.com/115250422803614415116/posts/hMT5kW8LKJk" target="_blank">discussion</a> in which many famous persons in the OSS community have a say.&nbsp;</p>
<p>IMHO, Gnome 2 has hurt the Linux desktop more than any developer mindset can achieve. That is another rant though.</p>
<p>Is it a bad thing that the Linux desktop is (apparently) dead? Is it dead at all? Linux is a lot of things. It runs on countless servers, has a hot stepdaughter in the moblie market (and a few ugly ones as well), is an excellent choice for embedded systems, and has even powered coffee machines as early as 1997. Furthermore, it does have a large number of window managers and desktop environments.</p>
<p>One thing is missing though: it is not a consumer OS. Many attempts have been made to beat the Linux desktop into submission and make it user friendly enough for the masses. The one distro that came closest, is Ubuntu, but they lost the way with their Unity desktop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The consumer desktop is IMHO a dead horse. First of all, the desktop metaphor is flawed. Everybody uses it, but think about it. What is the similarity between a vertical screen that is your window to the world compared to a horizontal surface that contains your work, and is commonly associated with a TL-illuminated hell? There must be a better way to make the use a computer understandable to a layman.</p>
<p>Add to this that many people want their home computer to exactly look and feel like the one they use at work, and voila, here's a major reason that Microsoft still dominates the home computer. They make desktops that fit dreary office life perfectly, and it shows in the blandness of their products.</p>
<p>The desktop metaphor is losing ground though. Smartphones and tablets are increasingly used in the homes many people. Why not anyway? Many tasks do not require a physical keyboard, and the point and click interface has been replaced by a more friendly point and tap interface.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The guys at Microsoft are seeing this. Windows 8 abolishes the desktop, replacing it with a more tablet-friendly interface. The flaw in their plan though is that they try to force this paradigm onto desktop PCs as well. Since the tablet is a totally different beast with totally different input methods, this will probably hurt the acceptance of their new OS.</p>
<p>Another 'desktop' environment that is slowly losing the desktop shackles, is KDE Netbook remix. It is buggy as hell, feels klunky at times and crashes daily on my machine, but the idea is a decent one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I for one am not certain whether the Linux OS should be a consumer OS. Admittedly, part of it is snobism. I like the 'developer culture' that Mr. de Icaza mentions. The user interface has grown though. Both KDE and Gnome have been obsoleted by OSX and even Windows 7. This is a harsh conclusion, but a fair one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps one should accept the idea that the Linux desktop is not for the masses, nor should it be intended to be. After all, a linux computer still requires a lot of manual tweaking. The desktops as they are serve a good niche. Many developers and hobbyists use and love the linux desktop experience. That does not make them suitable for the masses though, even if they save the users or sysadmins a lot of headaches.</p>
<p>Linux is reaching the masses, if only disguised as its hot stepdaughter. After all, ATM, the&nbsp; the only viable more-or-less-open mobile OS is Android. Maybe this is as it should be. Drop the calcified desktop and go for the sexy new interfaces. Open source is all about moving on.</p>
