<p>So how about the sordid story of me running semi-naked and sweating heavily through Bourbon Street, which happens to be New Orleans's Red Light District? Read on...</p>

<p>We arrived in New Orleans in the early afternoon. The hotel was not particularly difficult to navigate to, but somehow it had hidden itself well. However, on our second attempt we did spot it, and after giving our car to the valet, we could check in. Luckily, we had our navigation device with us, because otherwise we would never have found the way out of our quite spacious hotel room. Okay, I may be exaggerating a bit, but we did get a huge hotel room for a very decent price, and apparently, one television was not enough. It was quite luxurious. We were quite happy here.</p>

<h2>French Quarter</h2>

<p>The French Quarter is the oldest part of New Orleans. As the name implies, this part was built by the French, and the New Orleans people have tried to keep the buildings as authentic as possible. The streets are lit with gas lights, there are no traffic lights at all and in some places, even the pavement is still as it was in the old days. The houses commonly have French balconies, made from wrought iron. Since the Quarter is essentially a huge tourist trap, it has many many restaurants, cafes, bistros and other eateries that serve traditional Cajun or Creole food. Both cuisines are extremely spicy, so there is a constantly lingering spicy aroma in the narrow streets. Mind you, there are several other ingredients to this aroma. It stinks of urine, natural gas and disinfectant in the morning when the cleaning crews are busy. Add to this the sound of (mostly) Jazz music and Dixieland, and you'll get a feel of the atmosphere of this part of town.</p>

</p>

<p>Aside from the sometimes mediterranean look and feel, there is a distinctly Vegas-esque vibe about the Quarter. In our early walks, one of the first things we encountered, was Bourbon Street. It was literally a block away from our hotel. Bourbon is the hub of the Quarter with many rowdy night clubs (some of which bear the name of skin mags), cocktail bars, cocktail stalls that distribute milkshake-sized cocktails, souvenir shops, drunks (both tourists and locals) and scantily clad and otherwise loose women. Especially at night, Bourbon street is a huge cacaphony, but when you finally run out of clubs and bars, it changes into a relatively quiet, laid back neighbourhood with a distinctly French look &amp; feel.</p>

<p>Whereas Bourbon Street is the most rowdy part of the French Quarter, the most attractive part is IMHO the Mississippi Riverside with its markets, its cafes and its boardwalk. The souvenir shops disappear. Instead, you get stalls with local art, fresh fruit and vegetables and of course food stalls where you can get a quick bowl of Gumbo (which is Creole for 'we chuck in whatever we can find'). Apparently, it is popular among runners as well, which is to be expected. After all, it is a relatively safe part of town which is extremely light on traffic.</p>

</p>

<p>There are several other interesting streets and squares, like Royal Street with its antique shops, that actually sell old stuff. Furthermore there is Jackson Square with its blindingly painted cathedral, nice park and huge equestrian statue of Andrew Jackson. Interesting about this statue is that the horse is standing on its hind legs. In order to be able to do so, the statue had to be carefully balanced. Otherwise it would topple over. Andrew Jackson led the Battle for New Orleans against the British in 1815 and would become the US president in 1029. Yay!</p>

<h2>Garden District</h2>

<p>If you walk out of the French Quarter, and you go through the CBD (which stands for Central Business District), eventually you'll reach the Garden District. Mind you, some people in our select travel group thought the walk a bit too strenuous, so we took the streetcar back to the Quarter in the end.</p>

<p>The Garden District was originally part of the city of Lafayette, which was annexed by New Orleans somewhere in the 19th century. The former plantations were sold to rich people who did not want to live with the Creoles in the French Quarter. As the population grew, the gaps between the former plantation mansions were filled up with Victorian style houses. This resulted in the Garden District in its current form: lots of antique houses from different periods.</p>

<p>Currently, it is a very expensive neighbourhood, with many famous inhabitants. Perhaps, this is one of the main reasons why so many tourists visit this district. They want to see how the rich and famous live. Most historic landmarks are houses where famous people were born, used to live or are still living (although the latter is generally kept hushed for privacy reasons).</p>

<h3>Lafayette cemetery #1</h3>

<p>In the middle of the Garden District there is a one city block sized cemetery called Lafayette cemetery #1. As cemeteries go, this is apparently the place to be. As with the living part of the Garden District, Lafayette houses a number of illustrious people (I did not shake their hands, so I cannot verify). Apart from that, it is full of huge family tombs, some of which are 180 years old.</p>

<p>Interestingly, it is a New Orleans custom to bury their dead <em>above</em> ground. There is quite a good reason for it: flooding. It would not be a pleasant experience to see the dearly departed float by. An added advantage is the ability to stack the dead. There were tombs that housed over three generations. To be honest, I do not know whether the dead are kept in there eternally, but seeing that some tombs have been left undisturbed since the 1840s, it would appear so.</p>

<p>Sadly, many tombs were in sorry state. Although there are initiatives to restore the tombs to their old glory, many are still crumbling. I hope that when they are finally restored, they have some kind of archive of who lies where.</p>

<h2>Before leaving the Big Easy</h2>

<p>Note that I am not writing all of this down in a more or less chronological order. This is intentional. Trying to hammer this into this format would harm my experience in this wonderful city. Another intentional thing is not writing anything about the profound poverty, that can be seen anywhere and the damage done by Katrina (although there were even city tours for this theme). Both can be seen very clearly in the streets. They are as much part of the New Orleans experience as the <em>laissez-faire</em> attitude on the streets.</p>

<p>Oh, lest I forget. Yes, I did run scantily clad through Bourbon Street. It was at the end of a 10 kilometer run in the blistering New Orleans heat, so that would explain the revealing clothes and the sweat. Sorry for scarring you for life, folks. But I made you look, you perverts!</p>
