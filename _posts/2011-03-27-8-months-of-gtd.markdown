<p>It's been 8-ish months since I read <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/gtdguy" target="_blank">David Allen</a>'s excellent book <a href="https://secure.davidco.com/store/catalog/GETTING-THINGS-DONE-PAPERBACK-p-16175.php" target="_blank">Getting Things Done</a>. I read this book in order te be better organized. How did it work out for me?</p>

<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>First of all, let's make the assertion that both me and the wife are chronic procrastinators. Furthermore, I am a good programmer, thus I am lazy. Third: I am a busy man. Not only do I have long work days, that leave me physically and mentally drained regularly, I also have a social life and I need to keep in shape, which takes time and energy as well. In the past, many of my ideas and promises to myself were not too succesful. Some things I kept delaying, others I forgot.</p>
<p>I am always looking for ways to broading my horizon, and stumbled on David Allen's productivity method. He simply calls it Getting Things Done (GTD for short). At first glance it looked interesting. At second glance, &nbsp;it even appeared useful. I read a few 'tutorials' on the web, and took a good long look on the GTD Flowchart. Finally I bought the book.</p>
<h2>The book&nbsp;</h2>
<p>First and foremost, I really liked the tone. Mr Allen has a pleasant way of telling that getting your life more organized is not too difficult. The basic stuff is actually nothing that anybody could not come up with. All you need to do is organize all the input, and get a certain routine. There is a hard part, and that is routine, consistency, and keeping an eye on long-term goals.</p>
<p>A train of thought could be that somebody who writes such things that everybody knows anyway, is a sham. Let me derail that train for you. What matters is the way he puts these things in perspective. By writing things down as soon as they enter your mind, you will certainly remember them. However, what's next? What prevents these written-down things to remain in a limbo of hastily-scrawled ideas and TODOs? What GTD does, is organize all these ideas, thoughts and TODO's in a simple, yet effective system.</p>
<p>So far my review for a book that I read 8 long months ago. Let's move on.</p>
<h2>What stuck?</h2>
<p><strong>The barebone system</strong>. I kept the inbox, the project list and chores list, the Someday stack and Trash. My projects are neatly organized, along with any thoughts on them. My weapon of choice is <a href="http://zim-wiki.org/" target="_blank">Zim</a>, a crossover between a desktop wiki and a personal notebook.</p>
<p>I did recently realize that a number of chores are actually a mini-project. Maybe a more thorough weekly review is in order.</p>
<p><strong>A routine</strong>: &nbsp;When I leave the house, I always take pen and paper. I have a notebook next to my bed, in the car, on my smartphone, in the garage and even one in my office. I take notes when necessary and collect them in my inbox. What I do not do though, is a daily check and weekly review. I do this whenever I have the time.</p>
<p><strong>Inbox processing</strong>: Every few days, I empty the inbox and divide my stuff between my chores and projects. If I run into anything that I can file directly under a running project, I skip the inbox entirely.</p>
<p>All in all, the basics are there. I am more or less consistent in dealing with all the stuff that gets in my path.</p>
<h2>What did not stick?&nbsp;</h2>
<p><strong>Integrating professional and social life in one system</strong>: &nbsp;This is a bit strange, but the very idea makes me feel uncomfortable. I am not a nine-to-five guy and I am used to doing work-related stuff in my free time. However, I prefer a certain boundary between work and personal life, and this boundary is dissolved when integrating professional stuff in my personal GTD files.</p>
<p>For some reason, I use GTD pretty consistently in personal life, but somehow I happily ignore it for work. My work would probably benefit from using a more GTD-like approach. The question is why. Maybe this will be a future blog entry.</p>
<p><strong>Inbox processing</strong>: the E-mail kind that is. I hate using folders in E-mail clients, but do not want to toss everything right away. I act upon mail when needed. I even create GTD items based on mail, but somehow I am not entirely comfortable using my email client as a GTD tool.</p>
<p><strong>Tickler files</strong>: Never felt the need. I put reminders in my calendar when something needs to be done by a certain date. Either that, or I immediately &nbsp;take action when possible. Case closed.</p>
<h2>Finally&nbsp;</h2>
<p>One of the things on my todo list is to reread this book and see what stuck and which parts I conveniently forgot (or conciously ignored) and forgot to mention is this post.</p>
<p>Second, GTD is a way of thinking, not a religion. Let it be clear that I am a believer. GTD is a nice way of coping with a continuous stream of new stuff in the Real World. This is not unlike your average religion or spirituality. However, the GTD method is a loose way of doing stuff. Nothing is written in stone. It was never intended to be The Ten Commandments. Furthermore, there are no old men in funny clothes who try to tell you how to think.</p>
