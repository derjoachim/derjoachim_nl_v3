## Refactor of derjoachim.nl in Jekyll

Welcome to the third version of [derjoachim.nl](http://derjoachim.nl). Although the second version is pretty mobile friendly and fully responsive, a number of things 
irritate me. Also, for my purposes, Joomla! is a bit overkill. For a simple blog, Joomla! is IMHO too heavy. Therefore, I switched to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).
