<p>
	Thanks to the <a href="http://nooku.org" target="_blank">Nooku</a> guys for introducing me to Jekyll. Your community rocks! Also, your website was a huge inspiration in many ways.
</p>
<p>
	Another shout-out for all the readers that returned and retweeted blog posts. My audience is small, but loyal. I hope.
</p>
<p>
	Finally, a word of appreciation to all the developers of the open source tools and techniques that made it possible for me to actually develop a blog like mine. I gave them <a href="/stack/">a full page</a>.
</p>
