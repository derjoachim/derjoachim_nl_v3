    <p>As you've most likely found out by now, we are all big fans of <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a>. Vagrant is the tool that powers our Nooku development environment and makes sure you can start coding right away by managing this virtual environment for you.</p>

<p>We've launched the first Nooku Server box little more than a year ago. In good Nooku tradition, we have revised our approach more than once over the past year.</p>

<h3>A little bit of history</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/nooku/nooku-server/releases/tag/v1.0.0">v1.0 version</a> was a separate repository that required additional configuration before you could use it. You had to tell it where to find your Nooku Framework code first and then build the box yourself.</p>

<p>To try and improve this workflow, we moved the Vagrant configuration into Nooku Framework itself and tagged it <a href="https://github.com/nooku/nooku-server/releases/tag/v2.0.0">v2.0</a>. Better, but not quite there yet: each time you clone the framework repository, you still had to build the box at first run. A time consuming process!</p>

<p>Not to mention the fact that an updated version of PHP or MySQL could break our configuration, throw build errors all over the place and prevent you from getting a working box at all!</p>

<h3>Vagrant Cloud to the rescue</h3>

<p><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2900/14433258990_bac699b844_m.jpg" title="Vagrant Cloud" width="220" style="float: right; margin: 6px" /></p>

<p>With the recent release of <a href="https://vagrantcloud.com/">Vagrant Cloud</a>, however, all these issues are now a thing of the past. <a href="https://vagrantcloud.com/">Vagrant Cloud</a> is a hosted service for finding and sharing Vagrant boxes, managing Vagrant Share, and much more.  For a complete introduction, head over to their original <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/blog/vagrant-1-5-and-vagrant-cloud.html">release announcement</a>.</p>

<p>We moved the Vagrant configuration back into the separate Nooku Server repository and tagged it <a href="https://github.com/nooku/nooku-server/releases/tag/v3.0.0">v3.0</a>. We now build the box once after each new release and publish it as <a href="https://vagrantcloud.com/nooku/box">nooku/box</a> on Vagrant Cloud.</p>

<h3>Hassle-free coding</h3>

<p>When you clone the Nooku Framework repository and run the <code>vagrant up</code> command, it will automatically download the latest build and you'll be up and coding in no time!</p>

<p>Once you have downloaded the latest version, you'll never have to redownload again. All your new Nooku Framework projects will <em>just work</em> out of the box!</p>

<p>And best of all: as soon as we release a new version, Vagrant will tell you about it the next time you fire up one of your projects. It doesn’t get any easier than this!</p>

<p>All that’s left for you to do is to <a href="https://github.com/nooku/nooku-platform#installation">dive in</a> the code headfirst and have fun!</p>
