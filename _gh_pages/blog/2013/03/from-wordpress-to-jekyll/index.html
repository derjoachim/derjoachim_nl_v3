    <p>Did you notice? Probably not. Last month we switched off the database responsible for keeping our blog up and running and moved to a static solution using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.</p>

<p>For those not familiar, Jekyll is an awesome open source generator of static sites written in Ruby. Jekyll can generate HTML pages from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> and other markup syntax, without the
need for a database.</p>

<p>Don’t get us wrong. Wordpress is great for blogging, if you are looking for a simple and streamlined user interface that requires almost no technical knowledge. If you have a group of uber trained geeks running around, well, Wordpress is a bit overkill.</p>

<p>Jekyll to the rescue! Jekyll not only makes things simpler, leaner and faster, because the blog is now a static site it also provides a few additional benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>We don't need to run php and mysql where we host the blog, resulting in less resources used on our servers, near to zero maintenance and increased security.</li>
<li>We now have an improved publishing flow for the team using <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, and one less login account for each of us to remember.</li>
</ul>


<h2>How to switch from Wordpress to Jekyll.</h2>

<p>While switching from Wordpress to Jekyll we had learned a few things along the way that might be useful if you are considered a similar transition.</p>

<h3>1. Properly export and convert every Wordpress post to Markdown syntax.</h3>

<p>For this, we used the <a href="https://github.com/benbalter/wordpress-to-jekyll-exporter">Wordpress to Jekyll exporter</a>: a one-click Wordpress plugin that converts all posts, pages, taxonomies, metadata and settings to Markdown for you, ready to be dropped into Jekyll.</p>

<h3>2. Create an archive navigation similar to what is built-in into Wordpress.</h3>

<p>Luckily Jekyll allow for plugins to be added in order to solve such needs, and a plugin that does just that is the <a href="https://github.com/shigeya/jekyll-monthly-archive-plugin">jekyll-monthly-archive-plugin</a>.</p>

<h3>3. Adding readmore separator to post lists.</h3>

<p>When exporting wordpress posts using the Jekyll exporter, the Wordpress read more markup is exported as well into the new markdown files, in the form of:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="c">&lt;!--more--&gt;</span></code></pre></div>


<p>By taking advantage of <a href="http://docs.shopify.com/themes/liquid-basics">Liquid</a> (the template engine that come with jekyll, which supports HTML as well as various flavours of markdown) you can simply use the liquid split filter by writing something like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">{{ post.content | split:&quot;<span class="c">&lt;!--more--&gt;</span>&quot; | first }}</code></pre></div>


<h3>4. Disquss threads.</h3>

<p>We have some nice discussions going on here on the blog and we didn't want to lose them. Thankfully the Jekyll exporter also add the “dsq_thread_id”  to the generated markdown files. You can just access them via Liquid where you call the Disqus js plugin:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">var disqus_identifier = &#39;{{ page.dsq_thread_id }}&#39;; 
var disqus_url = &#39;http://blog.nooku.org{{ page.permalink }}&#39;;</code></pre></div>


<p>( the same with the url and permalink)</p>

<p>We are pretty happy with our Jekyll, if you are interested to learn what Jekyll can do for you? Head over <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">jekyllrb.com</a> to learn more.</p>

<p>Happy coding!</p>
