				<p>More and more Joomla developers are starting to use Nooku Framework for building powerful, extendible and secure Joomla extensions. The <a href="http://nekkidninjas.com/index.php/2010/07/26/ninjaboard-beta5-drops-from-the-sky">first</a> <a href="http://blog.anahitapolis.com/2010/05/anahita-the-alpha-girl-in-the-social-networking-universe/">generation</a> of <a href="http://blog.ohanah.com/?p=109">extensions</a> is in beta and more extensions are being worked.</p>

<p>Just like the Joomla 1.5 framework caused a wave of innovative extensions, we believe Nooku Framework is going to cause a shift: It changes how you <strong>create and use extension</strong>s, how extensions work <strong>with each other or with external data</strong>, and how you <strong>customize extensions</strong>.</p>

<p>At <a href="http://www.jandbeyond.org">J! and Beyond 2010</a> we, together with some of our Nooku Community Contributors and Partners showed some of the promising Nooku-powered extensions that are being built right now. Check out the video and take a sneak peek into Joomla&#8217;s future !</p>

				<p>Us developers are inherently lazy. Yes it true ! New technologies we greet with the needed scepticism. After all, why should we adopt a new technology if our existing tools work fine ?</p>

<p>The <a href="http://blog.nooku.org/2009/08/nooku-framework-goes-sourceforge/">public release of Nooku Framework</a>, now almost a year ago, was no different. Some people were <a href="http://www.dioscouri.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=678:the-nooku-framework&amp;catid=51:general-thoughts&amp;Itemid=209">very excited</a> while others welcomed the framework with <a href="http://dev.anything-digital.com/Blog/Does-Joomla-really-need-more-libraries.html">some reservations</a>.</p>

<p>A few days ago <a href="http://www.torkiljohnsen.com/">Torkil Johnsen</a>, Nooku Community Contributor, wrote an excellent blog post titled : <a href="http://www.torkiljohnsen.com/2010/07/15/what-is-nooku-framework-and-why-should-i-care/"><em>&#8220;What is this Nooku Framework thing really ? And why should I care ?&#8221;</em></a></p>

<p>In his post Torkil does a great job explaining what Nooku Framework is all about, how it differs from the Joomla Framework and why he thinks you should care.</p>

				<p>We are pleased to announce the release of <a href="http://www.nooku.org/content">Nooku Content</a> version 0.6.7. This version is a maintenance release that addresses a number of issues reported by our partners. A few smaller features where also added :</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Module translation improvements.</strong> We have further optimized the way Nooku Content deals with syncing of module translations and improved Nooku Content&#8217;s module translation workflow. Modules are no longer listed in the items overview and are also no longer taken into account for the statistics.</li>
<li><strong>Improved compatibility with K2</strong>. We have done extensive testing with K2 and fixed a number of smaller issues related to translating a K2 powered Joomla site. We are happy to announce that we now fully support K2.</li>
</ul>


<p>Together with the release of Nooku Content 0.6.7 we are also releasing Nooku Framework 0.6.7 which includes a number of smaller fixes. Nooku Framework is available through our <a href="http://code.nooku.org">Nooku Developer Portal</a>, for a direct link to the 0.6.7 SVN go <a href="http://nooku.assembla.com/code/nooku-framework/subversion/nodes/tags">here</a>.</p>

<p>Nooku Content is only available to our partners. By supporting us, you helps us to build quality open source software. In return you get a great extension, personalized support, and a voice in the development. If you want to learn more, discover our <a href="http://www.nooku.org/partners/why.html">Partnership Program</a>.</p>

				<p>We&#8217;d like to introduce two new members in the Nooku Team. First of all there&#8217;s <strong>Stian Didriksen</strong>, from Norway, our new javascript whiz kid. You may have heard of him: he&#8217;s one of the rising stars in the Joomla community. He is working with <a href="http://www.prothemer.com/">Prothemer</a> on the Morph template engine, and with <a href="http://ninjaforge.com/">Ninjaforge</a> on the Ninjaboard forum extension.</p>

<p>While Stian was working on the alpha version of Ninjaboard, he started submitting patches to the Nooku Framework, and especially to the javascripts parts. We liked it so much we decided to hire him for one day a week.</p>

<p>Daniel Chapman, Ninjaforge CEO, said: &#8221;</p>

<blockquote><p>For us this collaboration is working out great: several of our products are based on Nooku Framework, so having Stian work with the Nooku team for 20% of his time, is very beneficial for Ninjaboard, Ninja Content, Ninja Video Gallery, and Ninja Journal.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<h3>Gergő Erdősi</h3>

<p><strong>Gergő Erdősi</strong>, from Hungary, has been working with us for a while now, but we never properly introduced him. He’s definitely no stranger to the Joomla community. Gergő got involved with the Joomla Sites and Infrastructure Team in 2007. He participated in the Google Summer of Code, and wrote an advanced Joomla survey extension for that. He moved up to the Joomla Bug Squad and the Joomla 1.6 Development Team.</p>

<p>Always on the lookout for interesting developments, Gergő joined the Nooku Mailing List very early on, and displayed an amazing hunger for knowledge and capacity for learning quickly. We flew him over to Belgium to train him for a week, and got him started on building a Scientific Reference management application for our customer, the Italian Institute of Technology. As <a href="http://twitter.com/gergoerdosi/status/13618689365">Gergő wrote on Twitter</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>“One of my best decisions was to leave the Joomla core team and join the Nooku community.”</p></blockquote>

<h3>Strong Team</h3>

<p>We&#8217;re very happy to have Stian and Gergő on board, as we need the manpower to build our new Joomla- and Nooku-based multisite platform for the Belgian Police. The team is now nine people strong, and ready for even bigger challenges!</p>

				<p>During our three days at <a href="http://jandbeyond.com">J! And Beyond</a>, the International Joomla Conference, I was interviewed about Nooku Framework. Jack Bremer did an excellent job (it’s hard to believe he’s not a professional interviewer!)</p>

<p>We talked about the growing Nooku Community and the origins of <a href="http://nooku.org/content">Nooku Content</a> and <a href="http://nooku.org/framework">Nooku Framework</a>. In the middle it gets a bit technical, but hold on, after that there’s some fun stuff about the Joomlasphere’s obsession with Swahili names.</p>

<p>The interview was taped by Zohar Babin. He was at J! And Beyond in his role as Director of Developer Relations and Community for <a href="http://corp.kaltura.com">Kaltura</a>, the open source video platform, as they were sponsoring the event. Zohar decided to take the opportunity to learn more about Joomla, by interviewing a number of people in the community. I’m proud to have been one of them. Check out his technology blog for more interviews <a href="http://www.zoharbabin.com/j-and-beyond-first-day-interviews">here</a> and <a href="http://www.zoharbabin.com/j-and-beyond-second-and-third-day-interviews-recap">here</a>.</p>

<p>Jack Bremer, the interviewer, runs <a href="http://www.3bweb.com/">3B Digital</a> in London, a full-service digital marketing agency who specialise in Joomla projects, SEO and social media.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Better language syncing</strong>. We have made a number of changes to the way Nooku Content handles it&#8217;s language syncing especially during installation of extensions. Nooku Content is now smart enough to sync modules that are installed as part of the installation of a packaged extension. For example, DOCman, or K2, etc ..</li>
<li><strong>Better error handling</strong>. We re-worked our error handling to throw nice and meaning-full error messages when something goes wrong, for example when a language cannot be found.</li>
</ul>


<p>If you want to see Nooku Content in action, you can find our team this weekend at the<a href="http://blog.nooku.org/2010/05/special-treat-at-j-and-beyond/"> J and Beyond conference</a> We are sponsoring the event and are also doing a Nooku Framework workshop on Tuesday.</p>

				<p>As Nooku Framework gets closer to the 0.7 stable release, and the growing Nooku community started contributing more and more, we knew we needed a place to manage all that. Not just the Nooku Framework core, but also the side projects, the documentation, the example code, the developer tools, and all the contributions from the community. After carefully researching both self-hosted solutions and web services, we chose  <a href="http://www.assembla.com">Assembla</a> to build the <a href="http://blog.nooku.org/2010/04/nooku-developer-portal-opens-doors/">Nooku Developer Portal</a> on.</p>

<p>Not only is it a great project management solution, we found the Assembla to be very responsive to our never ending feature requests. Apparently this got Nooku on their radar: <a href="http://blog.assembla.com/assemblablog/tabid/12618/bid/12639/Featured-Open-Source-Project-Nooku-Framework.aspx">Assembla has chosen Nooku as featured Open Source project of the month.</a></p>

<h3>&#8220;&#8230; a magnificent framework&#8221;</h3>

<p>From the article:</p>

<blockquote><p>Their developer portal is also a fantastic example of what&#8217;s possible with Assembla. They have made use of wikis, the portfolio tool, multiple subversion repositories, and the custom branding tool to make the look and feel of the portal fit the Nooku design aesthetic.</p>

<p>When we asked Johan why he chose Assembla, he said: &#8220;Assembla is one of best software management tools for community driven Open Source projects. It&#8217;s simple to use yet offers all the richness we needed to be productive from day one. It marries free and paid services together which is ideal for OS projects that expect to become big. Assembla will be key in helping us to grow our Nooku community.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Alex Coisman, VP of Marketing at Assembla said:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Some open-source projects have already sprung up around this fairly young framework (&#8230;) I&#8217;m sure even more Nooku-powered projects will surface in the near future, as Johan Janssens and team have released quite a magnificent framework.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
