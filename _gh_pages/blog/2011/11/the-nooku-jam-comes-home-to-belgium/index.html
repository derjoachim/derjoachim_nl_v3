    The biggest Nooku Jam of the year is happening this weekend in Belgium. With the theme “Creativity, Innovation and Inspiration”, the Nooku jam is coming home (technically a few miles from Nooku HQ). <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/2326534728">Nooku Jam Leuven</a> brings Nookuers from all over.
  </p></p>

<p>  <p>
    Everyone who signed up for the Nooku Jam Leuven in the <a href="http://www.flandersdc.be/en">FlandersDC Creativity Lab</a> will be treated to a day of intense presentations, discussions, brainstorms, workshops, and hackathons around specific areas of the Nooku project.

    Dissecting the Nooku Jam
  </h4></p>

<p>  <p>
    There always seems to be a Nooku Jam event in some part of the world. We have had Nooku Jams in three continents the past year! So what exactly happens in a jam?
  </p></p>

<p>  <p>
    <a title="Nooku Jam Stockholm SE - February 2011 by Nooku, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nooku/5516536345/"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5133/5516536345_085e09e578.jpg" alt="Nooku Jam Stockholm SE - February 2011" width="500" height="333" /></a>
  </p></p>

<p>  <p>
    A Nooku Jam is an open, participatory workshop-event, whose content is provided by participants. The concept is very similar to a <a href="http://barcamp.org/w/page/405173/TheRulesOfBarCamp">barcamp</a>.
  </p></p>

<p>  <p>

  </p></p>

<p>  <p>
    Nooku Jams are never your traditional conferences &#8211; they are more of an ad-hoc unconference born from the desire for people to share and learn in an open environment.  Anybody can speak on any topic that they are passionate about. For Nooku developers, this means their latest code, component, or mini project. It is an intense event with discussions, demos and interaction from the attendees.
  </p></p>

<p>  <h4 dir="ltr">
    There are no spectators, only participants.
  </h4></p>

<p>  <p>
    Attendees must give a demo, a session, or help with one, or otherwise volunteer / contribute in some way to support the event. Participants won&#8217;t need to decide what to talk about until they get there. All presentations are scheduled the day they happen.
  </p></p>

<p>  <p>
    The day would start with the suggestion of the sessions. Everybody describes the kind of session they can do. Then the session gets pinned on the board for a certain time slot. After the planning – voila – there is a schedule and the sessions start.
  </p></p>

<p>  <p>
    For Nooku Jam Leuven, there will be four speaking rooms.  We&#8217;ll build a schedule with speakers together on a whiteboard starting at 9:30 AM on November 26th, 2011, the day of the event.
  </p></p>

<p>  <h4 dir="ltr">
    It’s about community
  </h4></p>

<p>  <p>
    The jam is also about putting a face on a lot of quirky mailing list and IM nicknames, and to spend some quality time together. The Nooku community works hard online so they should party hard offline too!
  </p></p>

<p>  <p>
    Anyone with something to contribute or with the desire to learn is welcome and invited to join a Nooku Jam. When you come, be prepared to share with other attendees. When you leave, be prepared to share it with the world.
  </p></p>
