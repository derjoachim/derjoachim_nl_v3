    			<p>Follow us, intrepid travellers, deeper into the Louisiana wetlands as we approach the city of New Orleans.</p>




<h2>Chicot State Park</h2>




<p>From Alexandria, we were to find ourselves a way to the environs of Lafayette. The fast way would have been Hwy 49, but that would have been too easy. Instead, we took the less-traveled road and hoped for more interesting views. After following LA 167 for some time, we reached <a href="http://www.crt.state.la.us/parks/ichicot.aspx" target="_blank">Chicot State Park</a>. It is essentially a wildlife reserve-annex-arboretum with its own man-made lake. The wetlands didn't live up to their name. Actually, they were bone dry, although the vegetation was lush. The heat and humidity were sweltering, the mosquitos were numerous and aggressive. Whereas Kim fled into the car, I decided to explore somewhat further, thus losing about a pint of blood to the mosquitos. I encountered some spiders the size of my hand, so <em>somebody</em> likes mosquitos, in the same way that said mosquitos liked me. Maybe I should have come later. The following day, the weather would be equally sweltering, but considerably more moist and actually seeing some <em>wet</em> wetlands...</p>

<p>Next stop: lunch! We ate our first po-boys. These are essentially loafs of 'French' bread (which as about as French as let's say quality cars), with essentially everything on them. For American standards, the bread was quite edible, even enjoyable. The filling was shrimp. Lots of 'em. These culinary marvels were eaten in a very old-looking little diner, run by a ragtag bunch of cheery black guys. Root beer refills were done from a gallon jug, the waiter wore a jester cap. He spoke with a thick Carribean accent and had a wide crooked grin with lots of golden teeth.</p>




<p>After following the road to Lafayette, and having seen many sugar cane fields, cotton fields, ramshackle huts (complete with rusting car wrecks), and rotting vegetation, we stopped for the night. The restaurant that we visited looked more like the assembly hall of a crematorium than a hotel, but the food was good, the waitress had a good sense of humor and many shrimp found their way into my belly.</p>




<h2>Oak Tree Plantation</h2>




<p>Our original plan included a swamp tour near Lafayette. However, when we opened the curtain, we found some all-too-familiar weather: rain. Lots of it. After double checking, the tour was cancelled. Bummer. So, another drive through the back country it was. After following the LA 87 for some time, we stumbled upon a village named Franklin, that had the familiar southern charm. Think French style mansions, trees overgrown with Spanish moss and the well-known lines at the employment office. Remember, Louisiana is a state where poverty soars.</p>




<p>One of the things that Kim really wanted to see, was an old plantation. We set course for the best one called <a href="http://www.oakalleyplantation.com/welcome.html" target="_blank">Oak Alley Plantation</a>, right at the Mississippi banks. It was thus named after the 400 meter alley of 300 year old oaks. The tour guides were all dressed traditionally, which meant that our guide of the day looked truly like a Southern belle. It suited her. The house itself had been restored to its original 1830s state. The surroundings even more so. All that remained, was to rebuild some slave quarters. After the tour, you could buy mint juleps, which is basically bourbon, ice and mint syrup. Me gusta.</p>

<h2>Laplace</h2>




<p>Our next stop for the night was Laplace (which is French for 'the square' or 'the place'). It was <em>a</em> place, but it hardly seemed like the place to be. We sent our first Baconators of the season to their final destinations (that is: our stomachs), and we just chilled in our hotel room. That was for the best, since the apparent dry spell was interrupted by a ferocious shower that lasted for at least an hour. It hardly had any effect on the sweltering heat. At 1900 hours, the temperature was still nearly 30 degrees. Since our hotel was literally built in the middle of a huge swamp, we had our fair share of humidity, so you can guess how we felt when leaving the airconditioned hotel building.</p>




<h3>Swamp tour</h3>




<p>Next morning we got another chance at the <a href="http://www.cajunprideswamptours.com/" target="_blank">swamp tour</a>. We were put on a boat by a certain cap'n Allen, a slightly gruff Cajun. First surprise of the day: alligators love marshmalllows. During our trip to the Bayou he would lure 'gators and raccoon families to the boat by well-aimed barrages of marshmallows. The most spectacular feeding was whipping several big alligators into a true frenzy, by holding pieces of chicken just outside the boat. The gators would jump out of the water and snatch the chicken out of his hand. No small feat, considering that gators have poor forward vision.</p>

    </figure>
</p>




<p>Cap'n Allen turned out to be a walking encyclopedia on the Bayou in general and alligators in particular. He effortlessly filled two hours with fun facts on both subjects. To name just a few: for every inch between an alligator's nose and its eyes, its entire body length is an entire foot. So, if the gap between a gator's nose and its eyes is 12 inches, stop speculating about its length and find a safe haven. They can run fast, and have a great endurance. You can trigger this by irritating the most sensitive parts of their bodies: the nose and the eyes. If you are stupid enough to do that, they will get snappy. Literally. They have a tremendous biting force, about 2000 pounds per square inch, which in European standards is over 13500 kPa. You do <em>not</em> want to get into a fight with one of them. They are practically invulnerable. A shot through the brain will do the trick instantly. However, the brain is the size of a walnut and protected by a very thick skull. Finally, baby alligators are cute, as long as you do not harrass them.</p>




<p>That's all folks. Our next stop is The Big Easy. Thank y'all fer readin'. See y'all nex' tahm.</p>
