    			<p>We left New Orleans behind us, and moved on to the Sunshine State. Seldom have I seen such a dramatic difference between two adjacent states.</p>




<h2>Leaving Louisiana</h2>




<p>We took the scenic route along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, along Hwy 90. This road through Louisiana and Alabama looked pretty nice. First we drove along the coastline, with many beach houses on stilts. These were generally 3 meters high or even more. The spaces beneath the houses were generally used as car ports or even dry docks for small vessels. Another stark reminder on how the weather and the sea can be.</p>




<p>There were still some bayous to be seen, but the vegetation, although equally lush compared to earlier visits, was generally more grassy. On the horizon, petrochemical plants could be seen. These were literally the high points of the landscape. After all, the rest was just flat wetlands.</p>




<p>Shortly after passing Mobile AL, the landscape changed dramatically. The bayou slowly changed into grassland, whereas the coastline suddenly began to show white beaches. The old, rusting shacks had been replaced by whitewashed houses with shiny cars. Yes. We had reached Florida. More specifically, we had reached Florida's so called panhandle, which is like a peninsula. Instead of by water, a panhandle is surrounded by borders (in this case with other states).</p>




<h2>Pensacola</h2>




<p>Our stop of the day was to be Pensacola. This city has one of several NASes along the Gulf coastline. NAS stands for Naval Air Station, which implies that the US Navy flies from it. This is entirely true: not only does it contain a major naval flight school, it is also home of the Blue Angels stunt team. Most interesting though is its Museum of Naval Aviation. And that was exactly what I wanted to see. Parts of NAS Pensacola are open to the public. One of these parts is the museum. For a very decent entrance fee (zilch), you can see quite a nice (and thorough) overview of all aspects of naval aviation in the past 100 years. Beside the literally hundreds of airplanes and airplane parts you can see carrier models, simulators, working models of jet engines, replicas of command centers and a lot of artwork on military aviation. Of course, the most spectacular part is the aircraft themselves. Navy aircraft used to have the habit of having beautiful artwork on their tail sections. Unfortunately, the way that the planes were arranged, made it difficult to properly make photographs. The good news is that I will not bore you with these photos, if only to move on to the next day.</p>

<h2>Panama City</h2>




<p>The road along the Gulf coast was to go on for several hundreds of kilometers. Since our early forages along the coast road had yielded some spectacular views, and since our road atlas had marked the rest of that road (being Hwy 98) as interesting for tourists, we decided to keep following the coast line. That was not such a good idea. All we did see was endless parades of chain motels and restaurants, souvenir shops and the occasional glimpse of the sea.</p>




<p>Furthermore, Florida suddenly lived up to its reputation as the Old Folks' state. Whenever a certain part promised to be interesting, some old rich dude had put up signs that barred any further entry, disallowed parking or even smiling. The people of Florida even appeared less friendly than all the neighbouring states. One other big difference is that a vast majority of the people were white. Actually, the people that were the friendliest, were the Indian guys at the motels. Especially the one that looked like Elio Di Rupo (which was probably a coincidence).</p>




<p>With this thought, we entered Panama City. After a meal at the local Applebee's (which was called Crapplebee's by a disgruntled customer on Tripadvisor, but still a lot better than most Dutch restaurants I visited) we went to bed for an early night...</p>




<p>...which was for the best. At 6 o' clock in the morning the fire alarm went off. Within a few minutes, two huge firetrucks were in front of the hotel lobby. Saturday morning at 6 is not a good time for firemen to be in action, judging by their tired and somewhat surly demeanor. Fortunately, they did not have to do much. Some idiot had set off the fire alarm by smoking in a non-smoking room. The cretin will probably face a $250 bill, and will have to pay for the firedudes as well. Good riddance. Smoking kills. If not for the nicotine and tar, then it is the angry mob with pitchforks and torches at 6 o' clock in the morning.</p>




<p>As for the city itself: suffice to say that apparently the only interesting part is the nearby beach.</p>




<h2>St. Augustine</h2>




<p>Our disappointment with the coast so far gave us doubt as to whether continue through a state park towards Tallahassee, or just leave the Panhandle altogether and see whether other parts of the state were more interesting, and less infested with rich old people. We chose tha latter and decided for a 500 km drive to the other side of the state: St. Augustine. This was actually quite a beautiful route. It ran through several state forests, and the views were so much better as the day before. It seemed that we might have made the right choice after all.</p>




<p>In earlier posts I may have been a little cautious about what the Americans consider historical. What they call antique, is often ugly oldish stuff that no sane person would buy, let alone display at home. However, the city of St. Augustine was actually one of the first Spanish settlements, and unlike many such settlements, it was not destroyed in some war. It actually had buildings dating from the 1700s.</p>




<p>After leaving our stuff in a decent, yet somewhat delapidated motel we set out to find out whether this little town lived up to its reputation. The first signs were less than encouraging. Upon entering the Old City, and leaving the Frankentaxi in a huge concrete parking garage, we found the first authentic alleys. These were full of tourist shops, restaurants, cafes, hobos and most of all entire hordes of tourists. Of course, the same junk was being sold as in New Orleans, Nashville, Memphis and other tourist traps. However, this tourist trap was quite cheesy as well. It looked like they had Disnified a perfectly good old town.</p>




<p><p>Fortunately, the old town was more than just the shops. After crossing a certain boulevard, the shops just stopped and the old huts changed into beautiful mansions, some of which were several centuries old. Add to this the lush vegetation with palm trees, ancient oaks with Spanish Moss and the complete absence of obnoxious tourists (with the exception of Yours Truly), and St. Augustine appeared worth the trouble after all.</p>

</p></p>

<p><p>No coast town is complete without its coastal promenade. This one did not disappoint either. There was a huge old stone fort, dating back to Spanish times. Furthermore, there was a true pirate museum, that we were sadly unable to visit since it was already late. We were just in time for sunset, which got us some beautiful views on the bay.</p></p>

<p><h2>Florida, Schmorida</h2></p>

<p><p>Although I would like to explore Florida further, particularly the Keys and of course Miami, the part that we saw was distincly less interesting than almost any other part of the States that we visited earlier. If I want old white people telling me what not to do, I will not have to go further than my home city. The coast, although beautiful, has been destroyed by mass tourism, and since all the interesting, colorful (and apparently: colored) people appear to have been banished to neighbouring states, this part of Florida is just a bland, sanitized version of California.</p></p>
