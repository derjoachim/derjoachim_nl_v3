    			<p>Today is a remarkable day. For the first time since 1983, I live in a house that has no desktop computers. All I have is two laptops and a NAS.</p>




<h2>Remade</h2>


<p>It's weekend again, and I have some downtime for myself. Time for some well-earned rambling. Since the late 1990's, all my personal computers were somehow named after characters in books. Sickbock, Dickerdack, Enoch, Remade and Anansi spring to mind. It is a neat system, and gives you geek cred.</p>


<p>Anyone &nbsp;familiar with China Mieville's steampunk series, knows about the Remade. Basically, the Remade are the steampunk variety of cyborgs. That is a cool concept. I built Remade in 2005. My old PC had died prematurely. It was a 3 year old PC and it had several servicable parts. Since I had just read Perdido Street Station, the hostname was quickly chosen.</p>


<h3>Remade remade&nbsp;</h3>


<p>An upgrade was made in early 2007. The PSU died. That was a good moment for a partial upgrade. I was remaking Remade. Cool! Among other things, I bought myself a passively cooled video card. Since the motherboard was still recent, I was stuck with AGP. Since one of my gripes with remade's then current configuration was its noise, I made sure to buy silent components. When remade still appeared quite noisy, I added some foam and other noise-dampening materials to it.</p>


<p>At that time, my primary computer was Remade. Video games were performing quite well (the games I played at least), and all the other stuff was done using my Kubuntu desktop. With my shiny 20" widescreen monitor, I could not be happier. Since the gaming had become more prevalent, I had moved my PC to the living room.</p>


<h2>Along came a spider</h2>


<p>In 2008, there was an exciting new thing in the world of computers. Asus released a laptop the size of a pocket book. The netbook was born. It must be mine! The first model had a pitiful &nbsp;7" screen, which even then was hardly useful at all. However, a 9" was announced with a more decent 1024 by 600 resolution. The very day it was launched here in the Netherlands, I bought one. When I first booted the netbook, I was stunned. Within mere seconds, I had a workable desktop! Wow!</p>


<p>I replaced the piss-poor Xandros impementation by an early netbook version of Ubuntu. The hostname was quickly chosen: anansi. I had just read Neal Gaiman's Anansi Boys.</p>


<h2>The beginning of the end&nbsp;</h2>


<p>Even with the main PC in the living room, it was rarely used anymore. Sure, when some photo editing had to be done, I needed a mouse and decent screen. The odd game still had to be played. And of course: my documents had to be archived every once in a while. Remade grew more and more into a backup medium. It still performed well for the things it was supposed to do though.</p>


<p>In September 2009, me and the wife moved to a bigger house. I made myself a nice room for working, studying and keeping loads of books. Although my father was joking, his name for the room was pretty appropriate: the gentlemen's room (Herenkamer in Dutch, not the men's toilet:) ). It was pretty well secluded from the rest of the house, and I could do my work (or fun stuff) in relative peace, even when the wife had her friends over.</p>


<p>In the 18 months that Remade was booted, it was to make backups of all my current documents, to play music when I was working in the garden, or do some unwanted stuff in Windows, like filling out the yearly income tax. A few months ago, I made the decision that Remade was to be replaced. Whatever it would be, it would not be a desktop PC anymore.</p>


<h2>Remade unmade</h2>


<p>A new process was started. What would I need to replace Remade? A decent new laptop perhaps? This would make Anansi obsolete as well, thus killing two birds with one stone. I wanted to wait though. At 2,5 years, I was not quite ready to say goodbye to Anansi.</p>


<p>At work, I got a new laptop. Twice. The first one was a nice HP 13" version. Although I replaced it in six weeks flat, I really like that machine. However, I was given an even better machine: a Macbook Pro. For me this alleviates the need for a fast notebook. If there is anything I need to do which requires a lot of processing power, I use my Macbook Pro.</p>


<p>A few days ago, I ordered a NAS. My archival / backup medium has finally been replaced. Furthermore, this NAS apparently has excellent multimedia capabilities.</p>


<p>This morning, with a heavy heart, I disconnected my trusty old PC. I took out all the parts that can be reused. Hopefully, these will live on, thereby remaking Remade.</p>
