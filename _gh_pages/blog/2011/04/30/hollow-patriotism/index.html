<h2>Dutch disease</h2>


<p>A few months ago, a columnist named <a title="Bas Heijne" href="http://weblogs.nrc.nl/heijne/author/bash/">Bas Heijne</a> wrote an article called &nbsp;<a title="De Ziekte die Holland Heet" href="http://weblogs.nrc.nl/heijne/2011/02/19/de-ziekte-die-holland-heet/">De Ziekte die Holland Heet</a>, which translates roughly as 'The disease called Holland'. For me, it hit home. For the people who aren't native Dutch speakers: in the last 10-ish years, a distinctly xenophopic and chauvinistic populism has crept into national politics and media. This is actively being exploited commercially, both in the media and commercial buisnesses like phone companies.</p>


<h2>Queen's Day</h2>


<p>Today is Queen's Day. Our parasitic queen's&nbsp; birthday is being celebrated. On Queen's Day, the Dutch do a lot of silly things. Generally, they act in a more-or-less normal way, priding themselves on being a sober and down to earth people. However, today they play games that even their grandparents would find boring, they get rid of old stuff in the attic by selling it on the street, they 'enjoy' our local pop stars (who ore not too good anyway, but that is another rant) and they dress up ridiculously in orange and the colours of our flag, getting openly drunk. All this because they happen to be in a certain geographical position. It does not make me proud.</p>


<h3>Klapvee&nbsp;</h3>


<p>Furthermore, our Royal Family is paraded through quaint cities and villages, being waved at by thousands of people. The Royal Family pretend that they actually enjoy these slack-jawed yokels waving at them and cheering them. This travesty is widely covered in the media. i shudder to open any news sites or switching on the television for news.</p>


<p>There is a Dutch word for this: <strong>Klapvee</strong>, which translates as 'clapping cattle'. People are being herded together to cheer for the queen. People love to do this apparently. They come by the tens of thousands every year (either that, or they are forced to).</p>


<h2>So?</h2>


<p>If you have already made this far, dear reader, allow me to clarify myself. What does queen's day have in common with Dutch Disease? Let me start by an observation: deep in their hearts, the Dutch are lost and unhappy. We appear flexible to the outside world, but the outside world has evolved beyond our legendary ability (or willingness) to adapt. This needs a way out.</p>


<p>Furthermore, in the last 40 years, the average Dutchman has um.. changed. A new world religion has taken root in our small country and that makes some people uncomfortable, even more if this religion is actively being linked to violence and terrorism by certain populistic parties.</p>


<p>If you look at Dutch enclaves in Canada or Australia, apparently these people desperately clung to their ideas of Dutch identity. I think that a milder, but more widespread form of this overcompensation is the root of both things.</p>


<p>In my observation and ensuing opinion, the extravagant celebration of queens day on the one hand and the extreme populism on the other hand are a way to cope with the fear of losing whatever people think that makes them Dutch. In Jip&amp;Janneke language (this one was carefully worded): people react to change by sticking to what they know.</p>


<h3>Me too&nbsp;</h3>


<p>I am doing exactly the same thing in my own twisted and cranky way. Normally, I am not particularly proud or ashamed to be Dutch, but on days such as this I overcompensate for the insanity of my fellow Dutchmen by blowing off some steam. Some people attempt kamikaze actions, but I write long boring rants. Either that, or I make sure to be out of the country. Happy queen's day, fellow yokels.</p>
