    			<p>This is a rant against stupidity. Recently, Amy Winehouse was found dead in her apartment, apparently of an overdose. Recently, the death of Dutch rock 'n roll legend Herman Brood was commemorated. He commited suicide 10 years ago by jumping from a large hotel in Amsterdam. Both events revulsed me. Not only did two troubled souls die in a horrible way, people were actually romaticising their deaths.</p>




<p>Disclaimer: I was not particularly fond of the music of Amy Winehouse. At best, I thought it was a young voice for the babyboom generation, with a dash of junkie chic. Admittedly, she had a good voice and her music wasn't too bad, but IMHO hugely overrated.</p>


<h2>'Addiction is cool'&nbsp;</h2>


<p>Arguably, her most famous song was 'Rehab', which was her way of telling to the world that she wanted no help. One could claim that she conciously chose not no quit. Former addicts and other people who witnessed addiction from up close, think that addiction chose her. Read this frightfully honest <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/jul/24/russell-brand-amy-winehouse-woman" target="_blank">article</a>. Anyway, one things never ceases to amaze me about this song: either people are oblivious on what this song is actually about, or they somehow consider it 'cool' to be an addict.</p>


<h2>Brood</h2>


<p>I am going to make a sideways jump and bring up Herman Brood. For those who do not know him, he was the Netherlands' self-proclaimed rock 'n roll junkie. He was a staunch defender of the 'live fast die young', 'sex drugs &amp; rock-n-roll' life style, and a mediocre muscian. He was in his early fifties when he died, and when he did, it seemed that everybody suddenly loved him. Pathetic really. He did have his fair share of close-ish friends, but many people obviously used his death for some free publicity for themselves. Furthermore, in the streets, every douchebag suddenly claimed that 'Herman' was their hero. Tell this to the people who had to scrape his remains off the pavement because he was a coward who could not face life anymore and needed one last bit of attention.</p>


<h2>Double standards</h2>


<p>People seem to have double standards on drug addiction. If the addict in question is the filthy man (or woman) in the street who begs for some small change to spend on a cup of tea, (s)he is shooed away or bluntly ignored by the same persons who hail the rock star junkie as gods. These are the same people who loudly sing along with 'rehab'. I am going to say it aloud: these people are fucking morons, who have no clue whatsoever about being dependent on that which slowly and painfully kills oneself.</p>


<p>In the end, all the fame and 'friends' in the world could not prevent these two lonely people from dying alone. It saddens me. There is nothing romantic about that.</p>
