    <p><em>This is a guest post from <a href="http://twitter.com/mblodau">Martin Blodau</a>, developer at <a href="http://pixpro.net/">Pixpro</a>, organiser of the first Joomlanight, and a Nooku community member.</em></p>

<p>The first Nooku Jam in Stockholm took place on the 5th of February 2011, in the conference area of the Swedish Media Publisher&#8217;s Association (TU), the day after the first Joomla Night.</p>

<p>We started the day with an overview about Nooku &#8211; its history, how it works, design patterns, examples and so much more. Pizza followed soon after! The pizza feast created a lot of lively discussions about the new possibilities of development with Nooku.</p>

<h3>Jammers showing crazy stuff</h3>

<p>The jammers driven discussions after lunch was next. I presented a custom developed project, Nooku Framework powered travel booking system, that was released just a few days before this Nooku Jam. I went through the workflow of the booking system and talked about my impressions of the development with Nooku Framework in contrast to earlier projects that were based on the Joomla framework.</p>

<p>Kristoffer Sandven from <a href="http://www.joomlablogger.net/">joomlablogger.net</a> presented a major custom project for an international organisation with Nooku Framework under the hood. I was really surprised by the awesomeness of this project. Everybody can name outstanding Nooku Framework driven extensions for Joomla but now I really wonder what awesome things integrators are building with Nooku.</p>

<h3>Dive into the Nookusphere</h3>

<p>For the rest of the day Johan, Tom and Stian showed us some cutting-edge projects in the Nookusphere, namely <a href="http://blog.nooku.org/category/server/">Nooku Server</a> and Nooku Desktop. <a href="http://blog.nooku.org/category/server/">Nooku Server</a> had been made available to the public the morning of this Nooku Jam. The participants already downloaded and played around during the first half of the day but we were now given the grand tour &#8211; and it was great!</p>

<p>We then got a more in-depth sneak preview of Nooku Desktop from Tom and Stian. This part totally blew my mind, it was my own little <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_effect">EUREKA</a> moment. As a result, I started to work on my own little <a href="http://www.appcelerator.com/">Appcelerator Titanium</a> application based on <a href="http://blog.nooku.org/category/server/">Nooku Server</a>, just for kicks.</p>

<p>All in all, it was a great event! It is always fun and inspiring meeting people that are walking on the same path.</p>
