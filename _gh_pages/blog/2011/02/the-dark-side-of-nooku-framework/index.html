<p>After we <a href="http://nekkidninjas.com/index.php/2011/01/14/ninjaboard-1-0-stable-released">released Ninjaboard</a>, our first major Nooku Framework based extension, Johan asked me to say a few words about what we felt about working with <a href="http://www.nooku.org/framework">Nooku Framework.</a></p>

<p>Aside from Ninjaboard, we have used the Nooku Framework on a few client sites for custom work. We are also currently porting all of our major extensions over the Nooku Framework. At Ninja Forge, we are hoping to be fully Nooku Framework powered in the near future.</p>

<p>There has already been a lot said about the good things that the Nooku Framework has to offer so I am going to do the opposite, I am going to talk about the downsides that we discovered when using the Nooku Framework.<!--more--></p>

<h3>Leaps of faith are required</h3>

<p>For those of you old enough to remember, there is a scene in Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade where he needs to cross a seemingly bottomless chasm. But as soon as he steps out over the chasm, he notices that there is a bridge there that wasn&#8217;t visible before from the ledge, as it appears to be part of the opposite wall.</p>

<p>Working with Nooku Framework often leaves you with a similar feeling to that scene. It does so many things automagically and, more importantly, correctly, that after wasting a couple of hours trying to code a solution yourself, you realize that it already does what you need it to. You just had to have a little faith and take a step forward.</p>

<p>In all honesty, it is quite unnerving until you get used to it, to have things just work without coding anything.</p>

<h3>Invoices get more difficult to justify</h3>

<p>Developing custom work is often so fast that we are finding it hard to justify invoices. On a recent job a customer asked for a quote to add some extra features &#8211; a couple of forms on the front end. Based on previous experience it would have taken me a day or two with regular Joomla/PHP coding, as I needed new controllers, views and models. However, Nooku Framework let me finish it within 20 minutes of them asking, as I only needed to code the form HTML and add some states to a request.</p>

<p>I made the mistake of showing it to the customer just after it was done, making it impossible to charge more than an hour&#8217;s work for it.</p>

<h3>Charging for support now fails as a business model</h3>

<p>For the most part, things run so well under Nooku Framework, that there are far less bugs in our code than before, meaning that customers won&#8217;t be signing up for paid support as much as before.</p>

<h3>Extension updates from Bizzaro world</h3>

<p>Development on Nooku Framework is progressing at a rapid pace, so much so that almost every week when we refresh our snapshot there are new features replacing what we were already doing manually, only better in most cases. The result being that updates to our extensions usually end up with more features but LESS actual code.</p>

<p>I have charted a graph which predicts that if the current rate of code deflation continues, our extensions will eventually need to absorb code from surrounding extensions on a site upon install in order to maintain their existence in the same time and space as the site.</p>

<h3>Non Nooku Framework development halted</h3>

<p>Whenever we go to work on our non Nooku Framework extensions now, we can&#8217;t help but feel limited, bored and frustrated.  If we had never used the framework then we wouldn&#8217;t know any better and so could be blissfully ignorant of the better ways of doing things. This has left us with no desire whatsoever to work on our older extensions, except to convert them to use Nooku Framework.</p>

<p>As you can see, there are a lot of downsides to Nooku Framework-based development, it&#8217;s not all just fun and games (though there is a lot of that)! Make sure you go into your next development project with both eyes open.</p>
