    			<p>People who actually talk to me in meatspace, already know this, but my motorbike is broken. My trusty BMW R1100RS died on me. As an aspiring mechanic with a modest set of tools, this was a nice challenge. My father helped me, for which I am very grateful. He has been a mechanic for about 40 years or so, but never specialized in motorcycles.</p>


<p>Read on and find out how (not?) to troubleshoot such a problem.</p>




<h3>What? What happened?</h3>


<p>On a bad day (it was a monday, that's how I know), I was riding home from work. It was late and I had had a long and exhausting day. The fuel light had been on for about 30 kilometers already, but I had just refueled. Happy to be able to finally go home, I was riding on the motorway.</p>




<p>Then it happened. I was overtaking a car when I noticed that my bike did not have the punch it usually had. I had to keep the throttle wide open to achieve the maximum speed. Not good. I was almost home, so I made the decision to try to make it home. That proved harder that it looked. As it appeared later, one of my cilinders just quit. When the rev count dropped below 3k or so, my engine just fell dead. However, I made it home without a scratch</p>




<h3>Troubleshooting Pt. 1 - wrong thinking</h3>




<p>Let's bear in mind that I had had a long day already. My first thought was that when I refuelled, the gasoline was somehow polluted. Remember, my troubles started shortly after refuelling. However, my father pointed out to me that one cilinder just did not run.</p>




<h3>Troubleshooting Pt. 2 - not the right tools</h3>




<p>When a cilinder dies, there are a few hints that it is actually a mechanical problem. The first one is to check whether one of the valves is stuck. Mine weren't. Furthermore, you can use a vacuum meter to see whether the pressure in the cilinder is right. Although my father has a vacuum meter, it was too short. We decided to test the electrical systems first.</p>




<h3>Troubleshooting Pt. 3 - not the right specifications</h3>




<p>If a BMW boxer runs on 1 cilinder, and the engine appears right, the problem is probably of an electronic nature. It can be one or more of the following things:</p>




<ul>

<li>The Hall-sensor is dead. </li>

<li>The HT coil is broken.</li>

<li>One of the spark plug cables is wonky.</li>

<li>The Motronic (which is the board computer) needs a reset or is entirely broken.</li>

</ul>




<p>The spark plugs were new. They had been replaced a mere few thousand kilometers earlier and they appeared fine. After playing for two minutes with a multimeter, the spark plug cables were approved as well.</p>




<p>The Hall-sensor is a different story. This one is easy to test with either a shiny special tool, or with a self made gizmo with a few batteries (8 AA does the trick), a LED and a few probes. Older generations of the R1100 engines had a flaw in the hall sensor: bad insulation. After some testing (both visually and with the gizmo), the Hall sensor was deemed OK.</p>




<p>Resetting the Motronic was easy. Of course you do not know whether it is actually broken and should be replaced, but that does not happen too often.</p>




<p>The HT coil was an altogether different story. I had three versions of the official BMW documentation (official, Haynes, and a technical spec page somewhere on the Internet), that stated that the internal resistance should be 13 kOhms between 2 pins and 0.5-ish ohms between two others. Mine was about 6.5 kilo-Ohms. AHA! The HT coil is broken! Finally! We have an answer!</p>




<p>Next step: we go on the Internet and buy a new HT coil. I took my trusty multimeter with me and paid a visit to a Beemer part shop. I was given three coils, but they gave the same values as my own coil. Strange.</p>




<h3>Troubleshooting Pt. 4 - back to the drawing board</h3>




<p>With my electrical system being satisfactory, we were back at square one. My father had modified his vacuum meter and now it was long enough. 5 minutes later we had the answer. There was absolutely no compression in my cilinder.</p>




<h3>Troubleshooting Pt. 5 - call the professionals&nbsp;</h3>




<p>That made me bite the bullet and make a phone call to the garage. I had gambled and lost. Last week they took my bike to the workshop and I got the bad news call yesterday. An exhaust valve had burnt and broken. The mechanic was kind enough to show me what the problem was, so without further ado: here's the pictures. Warning: if you like motorbikes, these are not for the weak of heart:</p>

<p><img alt="afbeelding048" src="/assets/images/posts/motor/afbeelding048.jpg" height="300" width="400" /></p>




<h3>Afterword</h3>




<p>All in all, it was an interesting project, and the end is still to come. I did learn a lot about my own bike. And I did learn a thing or two about how not to do some things. That is interesting as well. One conclusion I can draw is that it may have been a better idea to have the right tool at the right time. That would have saved us a few hours. However, we did not have that tool at that time, and we thought that it was worth the time checking the electrical systems first.</p>




<p>Thank you everybody for your help, kind words, advice and interest. Next time I prefer it not to be my own bike. My precious is much too precious.</p>
