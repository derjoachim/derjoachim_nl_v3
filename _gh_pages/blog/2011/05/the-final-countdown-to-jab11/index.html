Nooku will take part in the biggest international Joomla event of the year. We are kicking it off with an awesome <a href="http://nooku-party.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank">pre-event Nooku party</a>! The 5th of May will definitely be a night to remember. Registrations for dinner are closed but feel free to come and join us at the bar for some drinks or hit the slopes.</p>

<p>The JAB11 <a href="http://jandbeyond.org/programme.html" target="_blank">programme</a> has been Nooku-fied with four presentations from Johan, Stian, Tom, Gergo and Ercan.</p>

<h3>How to Build Native Web Apps with HTML5 and CSS3</h3>

<p>HTML and CSS have been quite nice for laying out documents but not so great for web app user interfaces. CSS3 includes a new module called the <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/tutorials/flexbox/quick/" target="_blank">&#8216;Flexible Box Model&#8217;</a> (aka Flexbox), which makes laying out user interfaces a far easier process.</p>

<p><strong>Who:</strong> Designers who want to take Joomla and their skill-set to a next level<br/>
<strong>When:</strong> <strong>Friday at 11:15 in Aula Minor</strong></p>

<h3>Nooku Showcase &#8211; A look into Nooku</h3>

<p>More and more Joomla developers are starting to use <a href="http://www.nooku.org/framework">Nooku Framework</a>. The first generation of extensions are being released, so JAB is the ideal time to introduce them to the world: Ninjaboard, Ohanah, Anahita, Akeeba Subscriptions, …</p>

<p>We will also demonstrate a couple of custom projects build using Nooku Server and Nooku Desktop. See Nooku in action, and find out what all the fuzz is about in this showcase!</p>

<p><strong>Who:</strong> Anybody who wants to see some workable Nooku magic<br/>
<strong>When:</strong> <strong>Friday at 11:15 in Aula Minor</strong></p>

<h3>Nooku Workshop</h3>

<p>Saturday will be Nooku Day, we have two sessions back to back which we are transforming into one big workshop session.</p>

<h4>1.  From Vision to Architecture</h4>

<p>In the first part of the workshop Johan will dive into the intricacies of the Nooku, and talk about the road travelled in the past 3 years from the initial vision to the architecture today.</p>

<p>This session is an ideal introduction into the Nooku Architecture with topics like : REST, HMVC, SOA, SOLID, ROA, GRASP, DI, …</p>

<p>Want to learn about the Nooku magic and understand how to Nooku-fy your own extensions and projects, don’t miss this session!</p>

<h4>2. Extension Development</h4>

<p>In the second part of the workshop we will continue where we left off @jab10. Together we will build a fully working Joomla extension with version, tagging and logging support.</p>

<p>We will explore how you can make full use of Nooku’s re-usability, flexibility and extendability. Show how to use the HMVC to mash-up components with one line of code and finally we will demonstrate our brand-new REST architecture.</p>

<p>Caution though, we are diving deep into the deeper layers of Nooku&#8217;s API. So come prepared!</p>

<p><strong>Who:</strong> Developers, hackers, enthusiasts, anyone with a passion for development<br/>
<strong>When:</strong> <strong>Saturday at 15:45 to 18:00 in Aula Minor</strong></p>
