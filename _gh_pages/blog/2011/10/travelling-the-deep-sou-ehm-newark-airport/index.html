    			<p>Since our vacation is officially over, consider this an unexpected appendix. I decided to write a blog post about the events of the last days of our holiday, but since we are neither in the Deep nor the South anymore, one could argue that it would not do to include it in the official series.</p>


<p>This blog post is about the flights home. We were supposed to board in Atlanta and catch the flight to Amsterdam in Newark. Although the airport of Newark has some nice views of the New York skyline, I am sorry to say that I have seen too much of it.</p>




<h2>Step 1: leaving Atlanta</h2>


<p>Our flight from Atlanta was to start in the middle of the afternoon. However, something strange happened. Another plane rolled in, and unloaded a large number of confused travelers. It appeared that this plane was bound for Newark as well, but for unknown reasons, at the last moment the departure was cancelled. This would seriously jeopardize our transfer to Amsterdam, so we got in line for some help. This had already been arranged though. Very proactive, for which kudos. Since the plane mentioned above was to go to Newark as yet, we could board that plane and have some more time to make the transfer.</p>


<p>After boarding, the pilot announced that he had not been given the green light to depart. After some inquiries from his part, it appeared that a cluster of thunderstorms was just over Newark, making it impossible for any aircraft to either depart or arrive. After about an hour, the plane was unloaded again.</p>


<h2>Newark NJ - day 1</h2>


<p>Of course, we had already anticipated that this would seriously interfere with our travel schedule. At last we flew, but we were already too late and the Amsterdam-bound plane had already departed without us. We were pointed to the right direction by some random staff member in a random place and even got a lift to the correct terminal. Nice. After arriving there, the feeling of powerlessness and frustration just began. Obviously, we were not the only people with trouble. Since nobody had been able to either take off or land, the terminal was thronging with angry, confused, or frustrated people. There were lines for everything, including the Men's restrooms. The airport staff members appeared equally stressed out or confused. There were simply too many people there to be orderly. Fortunately, we quickly found the correct gate. And then we had to walk on for several more gates, since the line started there.</p>


<h3>Queue</h3>


<p>Three hours in a queue is long, especially if you notice that many staff members appear unable or in some cases unwilling to help. Imagine several hundreds of people who are tired, hungry, thirsty, confused and above all unable to do anything about all of the above. The atmosphere among the people in the line was good. I have seen several acts of random kindness among the people, and since everybody was in the same boat, people swapped stories and the bits of information that leaked from either telephone calls with loved ones or airline helpdesks. I am less impressed though with the airport personnel. If you have a line with many many people in it, and it takes about 10 minutes per person to help her, you should do one or more of the following things: arrange information, get more people to the service desk to help travellers more quickly, feed the people in line, or distribute some water, arrange a place to rest. None of these actions were taken by either airport, security or airline personnel. People were literally left to their own devices without any means to change their situation or even getting insight what their situation was.</p>


<p>I dare not think about what would have happened if any panic would have broken out among the travellers for whatever reason.</p>


<p>We got in line at 19:30-ish and it was our turn at 22:30. At 22:45 we were to arrange a hotel ourselves (because of the weather, the airline was not responsible), and after a long and confusing phone call we had our reservation. Goody. All we had to do was wait for the airport shuttle and do the checkin. The hotel was overpriced, had a lot of options nobody would use, and the complimentary breakfast was replaced with an equally overprized bar. If I ever write a review on Tripadvisor, I will make it into a venomous rant. I am not going to name the hotel here though, but it is an anagram of 'Armada'.</p>


<h2>Newark NJ - day 2</h2>


<p>After our shamelessly expensive breakfast we went back to the airport. The lady had arranged for us that we could fly to Washington Dulles airport and hop on to the Amsterdam flight there. Sounded like a plan, but upon arriving the flight to Washington was so far delayed that we would miss the flight to Amsterdam as well. At the checkin, we were first ignored by all the staff, but finally, somebody with more people skills helped us. Her first question was why we had not been booked on the Newark-Amsterdam flight of the day. We were told that we would have to travel separately, so that was what we told the lady. It appeared that there was space after all, so we got new boarding passes again. Even better: no more transfers. As an additional bonus the nice lady had arranged that we could sit together.</p>


<h3>Waiting (but in a relieved kind of way)</h3>


<p>Although we are not in the clear yet, this is where the horror story stops. All we had to, was kill time on the airport. Since that was a six hour wait, we could have gotten bored out of our skulls. However, we were too relieved that we finally had a flight back. Our lunch was ridiculously cheap for airport food standards, and extremely nutritious (that is: we couldn't finish it). It was Chinese food, and as with all Chinese food around the world, a caucasian male with a healthy appetite is physically unable to finish it. I almost forgot to mention that the food was prepared in quite a tasty and healthy way.</p>


<p>Okay, enough about the food already. I was rambling and ranting about other things. Gradually, our gate was filling up with people, many off whom spoke Dutch. I must say that this normally irritates me. As tourists go, the Dutch are quite obnoxious, loud and rude. Oh, and the Dutch are everywhere, even where you do <em>not</em> want them, like within a 50 kilometer radius of you. However, this time it was a good sign. Maybe our flight would leave after all.</p>


<h2>"Mr. Hatred"</h2>


<p>Shortly before boarding, something which resembled my name was announced ("Mr. Hatred", Â no kidding). We were offered an upgrade to Business Class. We were specifically advised to say yes, and it would have been silly if we had not. I do not know whether this had anything to do with our earlier trouble, or that they were just smitten with my clean-shaven cranium. However, we bit. If you have never travelled business class before, this is quite an experience. Of course we agreed, even if we were not seated together (which was quickly solved by asking a nice Chinese lady to swap seats).</p>


<p>We had not anticipated being placed in business class. The food was excellent, as well as the drinks. I had single malt whiskey as an appetizer. There were not one, but two appetizers (one of which was salad). The main course was a huge grilled steak with creamed spinach (and I was sadly unable to finish it). There was not one but two desserts: a selection of cheeses and ice cream. Gradually the plane began to lurch a bit, since they fed me so well.</p>


<p>All in all, a travel horror story ended well. I am still unimpressed at crisis management at airports, but the airline itself made amends, and they did it well. One last remark: despite many transfers for our luggage, it somehow got on the correct flight, enabling us to take our suitcases with us.</p>
