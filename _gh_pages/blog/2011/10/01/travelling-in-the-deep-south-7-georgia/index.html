    			<p>After leaving the somewhat bland state of Florida, we returned to Georgia for the final leg of our journey. We instantly felt more at home. The plan was to visit Savannah, somehow spend our flexday and head back to Atlanta to return the Frankentaxi and fly back home.</p>




<p>As with almost any other road trip, the views were stunning. There is basically one way to get from St. Augustine to Savannah, and that is by driving the I-95, that closely hugs the coastline. Since several rivers flow into the Atlantic along the way, the landscape looked exactly like a river delta: flat, grassland with meandering rivers. Add to it the brilliant weather and you get a gorgeous view.</p>




<h2>Savannah</h2>




<p>Savannah is apparently high in the charts for local tourism. This reputation is well-earned. Before actually being informative, please allow me to give you a short anecdote about one of the first things that I did there: an early afternoon run. Even the suburbs are beautiful there with their Spanish Moss-laden trees, so I was thoroughly enjoying the view. However, the weather was hot and humid, and within a few kilometers I was sweating like a pig. I had to wait for a traffic light, and a passing bicyclist offered me a napkin in a perfect Forrest Gump accent to wipe the sweat from my not-so-covered cranium. Okay, now I am out of line here by having dropped the <em>other</em> F-bomb, especially after this random and spontaneous act of kindness. It does say something about the city though: you can find true Southern hospitality here.</p>




<p>Downtown Savannah is one big old historic center. It combines buildings from different architectural periods, dotted with over 20 little parks, each as big as a city block. This layout was intentional: the founder of the city, a certain General Oglethorpe, had seen the destruction of the Great Fire of London, and blamed it partly on cramped conditions. By allowing for more space among the city blocks, a similar fire would be less destructive.</p>




<p>All in all, the area is about a square mile, which makes for long walks through the district. The parks are green, lush and riddled with statues. The streets are lined with mansions, museums and art galleries. Since Savannah has a major art school, the inner city has a bit of a collegial vibe with its many bikes, little shops catering to students' need (more coffee!) and art supply stores. Furthermore, there appears to be quite a large Irish community here. We found the headquarters of the St. Patricks Day Foundation here, with a clock counting down to St. Patrick's Day.</p>

</p>




<p>On one side, the old center is bordered by the Savannah riverfront. Along its cobbled streets you can find a monument on their slave trade history, many little restaurants, a market, art shops and souvenir shops. All in all, it does not differ much from other riverfronts, but it is charming. It is in one of these restaurants that I had a spectacular lunch: the first dish was a fresh salad, which already took me some effort to finish. The second dish was a huge kettle of seafood stew, interestingly named Pine Bark Stew. It is a local recipe that basically says: 'Chuck everything in'. Sounds a bit like the Gumbo recipe I gave earlier, but it is more modestly spiced, and it apparently has more vegetables. The menu promised no pine bark, which is a bit silly, since this gave this interesting dish its name.</p>

<h2>Tybee Island</h2>




<p>At a measly 20 minute drive from our hotel is Tybee Island. The ride to this island is already beautiful in itself, but when you get there, too soon I might add, you enter a town that is probably the essence of what a beach town should be. As beaches go, it is everything that the Florida Panhandle beaches were not. First and foremost, there no signs telling you what not to do, except for the official ones. The atmosphere in Tybee Island (the city) was laid back. Of course it had its fair share of hotels and restaurants, but the big chains were not visible. Since the Days Inn started on Tybee Island, I must assume that I simply overlooked them. The beach itself stretches for several kilometers.As beaches go, it is clean and tranquil. Mind you, it is the end of the season at the time of writing, so I assume that it is normally more crowded there. However, it was great to be on a beach that did not look like it was built to milk tourists out of their dollars. I am not a beach person, but I would rate this one among my favorites.</p>




<p>If tranquil beaches aren't your cup of tea, there are a few actual forts in the vincinity. Fort Screven is little more than the remnants of a beach artillery battery, converted to a museum, and a few buildings that were converted to apartments. Furthermore, there is Fort Pulaski, which proved once and for all that stone fortifications were obsolete. Apparently, this fort was changed into Swiss cheese and proved the effectiveness of the rifled cannon. Last but not least, there is a nice historic (no, really! I mean it this time!) lighthouse that adds to the charm of this laid-back beach resort.</p>




<p>One more piece of trivia: in the Vincinity of Tybee Island, the US Air Force lost an atomic bomb in an airplane collision. That was in 1958. Over half a century later, it has not been recovered yet. Ouch.</p>




<h2>Back to Atlanta</h2>




<p>Our last stop was the city of Atlanta. We arrived in the late afternoon, and decided to go downtown. Unfortunately, we had but a few hours for this interesting city. We decided to visit two places: the Underground Market district and the Martin Luther King historical district. The underground market district (Underground for short) is less interesting than the name implies. Either that, or we simply missed the good parts. It is a six block district with many vibrant shops, partly underground. However, it was not as vibrant as we thought it would be, so we set out to visit our second target: the ML King historical site. To end with an anticlimax, by the time we got there, everything was closed. We were tired and hungry and instead decided to find ourselves some hot food.</p>

<p>Thus ends our Odyssey through the Deep South. We saw, smelled, tasted and felt a great number of interesting things. It appeared to be a friendly, hospitable part of the country (with the exriddledception of Florida), where life is either on steroids or laid back. I like both flavors. The landscape is less spectacular than the National Parks I visited on earlier travels, but the bayous are gorgeous, and the endles cotton fields have their fluffy charm. The people though stole my heart, especially in the Savannah region. They act nice and helpful, even if there is nothing in it for them, not unlike the Irish or Germans. We left this region with pain in our hearts.</p>




<p>But wait. There's more. Not just yet though...</p>
