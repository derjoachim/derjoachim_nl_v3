  <article class="post-content">
    <p>A year ago Steve Burge from <a href="http://www.alledia.com">Alledia</a> wrote a blog post titled : <a href="http://www.alledia.com/blog/product-reviews/joomla-goes-cckrazy/">Joomla Goes CCKrazy</a> taking a closer look at the CCK explosion in the Joomla ecosystem. In his post Steve defines a CCK as :</p>

<ul>
<li>any extension which allows to move beyond the text and title options provided by Joomla&#8217;s com_content, and choose your own fields and options.</li>
<li>any extension which also moved beyond the section/category hierarchy of Joomla 1.5 and 1.5.</li>
</ul>


<p>Today the Joomla <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org">extensions site</a> counts not less then <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/news-production/content-construction">10 GPL licensed CCK solutions</a>. All of which add advanced content management capabilities to Joomla. In a sense, each of the CCK solutions are mini CMS systems wrapped inside a Joomla extension.</p>

<p>Are CCK&#8217;s the answer to innovating Joomla ? I don&#8217;t believe so. One of the reasons I choose Mambo for my first web project back in the days was because it was easy to use and easy to extend. As a user I could set it up in 5 min, just running through the installer, and as a developer I could extend it in 5 min, just looking at the code.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The challenge when building a CCK&#8217;s is to find a way expose the complex business logic in a simple and straightforward manner to the content editor and site administrator. Because CCK&#8217;s are trying to cut the developer from the equation they need to expose a whole range of settings which could otherwise be implemented through code. More settings means more documentation, more code and a higher risk for bugs. Not an ideal scenario.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s not try to<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_Make_Me_Think"> make our users think</a>. Instead let&#8217;s try to make them accomplish their intended tasks as easily and directly as possible. After all wasn&#8217;t that the original vision behind Mambo&#8217;s : <a href="http://www.mamboserver.com/">Power in Simplicity</a> ?</p>

<p>If we want the same simplicity for Joomla we need to go back to focus our user interfaces solely on helping content editors get the job done. No configuration settings, no parameters, …  no setup. No complexity.</p>

<p>How ? By creating a more powerful framework that allows developers to build re-usable extensions for Joomla that can be easily combined together to solve many different business workflows. And by letting developers to what they do best : develop.</p>

<p>For example, most custom Joomla projects we have worked on are essentially com_content clones with some extra fields and a project-specific workflow. That, combined with, taxonomy, versioning, comments and permissions gives you most of the tools you need to build complex solutions quickly. You want a real estate catalog? Check. How about a magazine management system with organized issues and categories and tags? Check. Maybe a business directory. Trivial. An on-line help system? No problem. The list could go on.</p>

<p>Going back to Steve his definition :</p>

<blockquote><p>Nooku Framework is an extension for Joomla that allows developers to move beyond the text and title options of com_content and content hierarchy of sections/categories. It handles most of the work for you and provides you with a number of<a href="http://nooku.assembla.com/spaces/nooku-components/wiki"> re-usable components</a> that you can plug right in. You&#8217;ll need only a fraction of the amount of code to glue it all together allowing you to focus on what really matters: your business logic and user experience.</p></blockquote>

<p>All that makes Nooku Framework a very powerful CCK for developers. Don&#8217;t believe me ? <a href="http://www.nooku.org/framework.html">Get started</a> today,<a href="http://www.nooku.org/framework/request.html"> join our community</a> and find out yourself.</p>
