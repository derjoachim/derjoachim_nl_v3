    <p>On September 20, 45 Joomla developers, integrators and users traveled to Manila, Philippines for the first Asian Nooku Jam. The Jam was held at the University of the Philippines Information Technology Training Center (UPITTC) and facilitated by the man behind it all, Johan Janssens.  He  gave the jammers a whirlwind experience into the deeper and darker layers of Nooku Framework.</p>

<p>We had a great turnout for the jam with a very diverse crowd of IT professionals, with a sprinkling of students and a fairly even gender distribution. Most were working in private commercial organizations, but encouragingly there was a large contingent from the Philippine governments Department of Science Technology (DOST). Some were novices, a few were extension developers and a handful had actually already started toying with Nooku Framework, but all were keen to learn and fun they had !</p>

<h3>What is Nooku Framework?</h3>

<p>The whole day event was broken into two sessions. The morning half Johan gave an overview and introduction into what is Nooku Framework &#8211; the theory, principles, fundamentals, objectives and ideas behind it all.</p>

<h3>Stick to the code!</h3>

<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1049/5109839685_e1cf3f93cc.jpg" alt="Nooku Jammers while coding" width="500" height="174" /></p>

<p>After a hearty provided lunch, we dove right into the codebase itself in a hands-on session. The session focussed mainly on demonstrating Nooku Frameworks extreme re-usability approach and it&#8217;s magic. We did so playing a little game called Todo &#8211; Tada. It goes like this.</p>

<p>Each jammer got a local Joomla 1.5 installation with Nooku Framework and a simple Todo list component, written purely on Joomla Framework. Utilizing the power of Nooku Framework Johan showed how the same component would still work even if <strong>80%</strong> of the component files, folders and code were <strong>deleted</strong>. This only left a few component specific code files, the rest being leveraged from Nooku’s extensive Framework. It was at this point that most participants truly had their <strong>&#8216;eureka&#8217;</strong> moment and began to start appreciating the power of Nooku Framework.</p>

<p>In a final session Johan showed participants a preview of the exciting cutting edge work the Nooku Team is working on. He gave an introduction into the concept of the HVMC design pattern and demonstrated how it can be used to build rich user interfaces and web applications when combined with new technologies like HTML5 &amp; CSS3.</p>

<h3>The end of an amazing day!</h3>

<p><img class="alignright" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4042/5078710020_680f27b9aa_m.jpg" alt="Everybody together" width="160" height="240" />Everyone got to take home  a very snazzy Nooku Jam navy blue event shirts and after a group shot it was time to say goodbye.</p>

<p>The organizing team and some the local JUG&#8217;rs (Joomla User Group) ended the day with a great dinner and drinks at a nearby Persian restaurant.</p>

<p>All in all a long, action packed, but fruitful and exciting day for everyone, but most left wanting and raring for more. Here&#8217;s looking forward to more Nooku Jams in the future.</p>
