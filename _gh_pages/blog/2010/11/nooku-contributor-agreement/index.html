    <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nooku/5170154324/" title="Community by Nooku, on Flickr"><img class="alignleft" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1368/5170154324_bf551e9606_m.jpg" alt="Community" width="240" height="196" /></a>In July we <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/nooku-framework/browse_thread/thread/8d30f285d23490b8/eb83f881efe41dac">launched the idea on the mailing list</a> to setup a Nooku Incubator where developers can collaborate on building new an innovative <a href="https://nooku.assembla.com/spaces/nooku-components">Nooku Components</a>. Over the past few months we have been making steady progress. The Nooku Incubator is being setup as we speak and will open it’s doors in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>In order to ensure that everyone has the same understanding of and commitment to Nooku when they choose to participate in the Nooku Incubator we have created a <a href="http://files.timble.net/nooku-nca-v1.0.pdf">Nooku Contributor Agreement</a>.</p>

<p>In simple terms, the Nooku Contributor Agreement states that:</p>

<ul>
<li>You retain the ownership of the Contribution</li>
<li>You grant us a copyright license under the terms of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html">GNU LGPLv3</a>/<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU GPLv3</a>/<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html">GNU AGPLv3</a>.</li>
<li>You warrant that your Contribution doesn&#8217;t violate the rights of any third parties.</li>
</ul>


<p>This agreement protects your copyright, and allows Nooku and it&#8217;s community to grow and mature while relying on established and balanced licensing terms.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>With this agreement we are explicitly choosing not to <a href="http://www.fsf.org/blogs/rms/assigning-copyright">aggregate copyrights</a> as many other open source companies and projects (eg, Joomla) are doing. Instead we believe that open source can be defined as the co-development of software by a community of people who choose to align a fragment of their self-interest in order to do so.</p>

<p>The commons in which they work contains software under an OSI-approved licence free from usage restrictions with guaranteed freedoms to use, study, modify and distribute it &#8211; &#8220;<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a>&#8220;. The community members each work at their own expense in order to achieve a shared outcome that benefits all, including themselves.</p>

<p>When community members create an enhancement, fix a defect, participate in a design, they are not &#8220;working for free&#8221; or &#8220;donating their work&#8221; so much as they are &#8220;participating in co-development&#8221;.</p>

<p>We believe that having diverse copyright ownership leads to a deeper mutual trust and an assurance that the playing-field remains equal for everyone involved.</p>

<p>The Nooku Contributor Agreement reflects those beliefs and we hope it will strengthen Nooku&#8217;s growth towards a truly <a href="http://jukkaz.wordpress.com/2010/11/08/models-of-corporate-open-source/">open community</a> of <a href="http://blogs.computerworlduk.com/simon-says/2010/09/open-source-community-types/index.htm">co-developers</a>.</p>
