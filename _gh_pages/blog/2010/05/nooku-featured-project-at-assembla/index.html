    <p>As Nooku Framework gets closer to the 0.7 stable release, and the growing Nooku community started contributing more and more, we knew we needed a place to manage all that. Not just the Nooku Framework core, but also the side projects, the documentation, the example code, the developer tools, and all the contributions from the community. After carefully researching both self-hosted solutions and web services, we chose  <a href="http://www.assembla.com">Assembla</a> to build the <a href="http://blog.nooku.org/2010/04/nooku-developer-portal-opens-doors/">Nooku Developer Portal</a> on.</p>

<p>Not only is it a great project management solution, we found the Assembla to be very responsive to our never ending feature requests. Apparently this got Nooku on their radar: <a href="http://blog.assembla.com/assemblablog/tabid/12618/bid/12639/Featured-Open-Source-Project-Nooku-Framework.aspx">Assembla has chosen Nooku as featured Open Source project of the month.</a></p>

<h3>&#8220;&#8230; a magnificent framework&#8221;</h3>

<p>From the article:</p>

<blockquote><p>Their developer portal is also a fantastic example of what&#8217;s possible with Assembla. They have made use of wikis, the portfolio tool, multiple subversion repositories, and the custom branding tool to make the look and feel of the portal fit the Nooku design aesthetic.</p>

<p>When we asked Johan why he chose Assembla, he said: &#8220;Assembla is one of best software management tools for community driven Open Source projects. It&#8217;s simple to use yet offers all the richness we needed to be productive from day one. It marries free and paid services together which is ideal for OS projects that expect to become big. Assembla will be key in helping us to grow our Nooku community.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Alex Coisman, VP of Marketing at Assembla said:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Some open-source projects have already sprung up around this fairly young framework (&#8230;) I&#8217;m sure even more Nooku-powered projects will surface in the near future, as Johan Janssens and team have released quite a magnificent framework.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
